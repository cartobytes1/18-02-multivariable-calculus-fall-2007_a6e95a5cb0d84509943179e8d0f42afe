  <span m='23000'>Yesterday we learned about flux and we have seen the first few</span>
  <span m='28000'>examples of how to set up and compute integrals for a flux of</span>
  <span m='33000'>a vector field for a surface. Remember the flux of a vector</span>
  <span m='40000'>field F through the surface S is defined by taking the double</span>
  <span m='47000'>integral on the surface of F dot n dS where n is the unit normal</span>
  <span m='55000'>to the surface and dS is the area element on the surface.</span>
  <span m='63000'>As we have seen, for various surfaces,</span> <span m='66000'>we
  have various formulas telling us what the normal</span> <span m='69000'>vector is
  and what the area element becomes.</span> <span m='72000'>For example, on spheres
  we typically</span> <span m='74000'>integrate with respect to phi and theta for
  latitude and</span> <span m='78000'>longitude angles. On a horizontal plane,</span>
  <span m='81000'>we would just end up degrading dx, dy and so on.</span> <span m='85000'>At
  the end of lecture we saw a formula.</span> <span m='89000'>A lot of you asked me
  how we got it.</span> <span m='92000'>Well, we didn't get it yet. We are going to
  try to explain</span> <span m='96000'>where it comes from and why it works.</span>
  <span m='99000'>The case we want to look at is if S is the graph of a function,</span>
  <span m='110000'>it is given by z equals some function in terms of x and y.</span>
  <span m='121000'>Our surface is out here. Z is a function of x and y.</span> <span
  m='128000'>And x and y will range over some domain in the x,</span> <span m='137000'>y
  plane, namely the region that is the shadow of the surface on</span> <span m='148000'>the
  x, y plane. I said that we will have a</span> <span m='154000'>formula for n dS
  which will end up being plus/minus minus f sub</span> <span m='160000'>x, minus
  f sub y, one dxdy,</span> <span m='165000'>so that we will set up and evaluate the
  integral in terms</span> <span m='169000'>of x and y. Every time we see z we will</span>
  <span m='173000'>replace it by f of xy, whatever the formula for f</span> <span
  m='177000'>might be. Actually, if we look at a very</span> <span m='180000'>easy
  case where this is just a horizontal plane,</span> <span m='184000'>z equals constant,
  the function is just a</span> <span m='187000'>constant, well, the partial derivatives</span>
  <span m='189000'>become just zero. You get  dx, dy.</span> <span m='194000'>That
  is what you would expect for a horizontal plane just from</span> <span m='197000'>common
  sense. This is more interesting,</span> <span m='199000'>of course, if a function
  is more interesting.</span> <span m='203000'>How do we get that? Where does this
  come from?</span> <span m='210000'>We need to figure out, for a small piece of our</span>
  <span m='216000'>surface, what will be n delta S. Let's say that we take a small</span>
  <span m='223000'>rectangle in here corresponding to sides delta x and delta y and</span>
  <span m='231000'>we look at the piece of surface that is above that.</span> <span
  m='238000'>Well, the question we have now is what is the area of this</span> <span
  m='243000'>little piece of surface and what is its normal vector?</span> <span m='248000'>Observe
  this little piece up here.</span> <span m='250000'>If it is small enough, it will
  look like a</span> <span m='252000'>parallelogram. I mean it might be slightly</span>
  <span m='254000'>curvy, but roughly it looks like a parallelogram in space.</span>
  <span m='257000'>And so we have seen how to find the area of a parallelogram in</span>
  <span m='262000'>space using cross-product. If we can figure out what are</span>
  <span m='265000'>the vectors for this side and that side then taking that</span>
  <span m='269000'>cross-product and taking the magnitude of the cross-product</span>
  <span m='273000'>will give us the area. Moreover, the cross-product</span> <span
  m='276000'>also gives us the normal direction.</span> <span m='278000'>In fact,
  the cross-product gives us two in one.</span> <span m='280000'>It gives us the normal
  direction and the area element.</span> <span m='284000'>And that is why I said that
  we will have an easy formula for n</span> <span m='288000'>dS while n and dS taken
  separately are more complicated</span> <span m='292000'>because you would have to
  actually take the length of a</span> <span m='295000'>direction of this guy. Let's
  carry out this problem.</span> <span m='303000'>Let's say I am going to look at
  a small piece of the x,</span> <span m='313000'>y plane. Here I have delta x,</span>
  <span m='317000'>here I have delta y, and I am starting at some point</span> <span
  m='322000'>(x, y). Now, above that I will have a</span> <span m='328000'>parallelogram
  on my surface. This point here,</span> <span m='334000'>the point where I start,
  I know what it is.</span> <span m='336000'>It is just (x, y). And, well, z is f(x,
  y).</span> <span m='343000'>Now what I want to find, actually,</span> <span m='344000'>is
  what are these two vectors, let's call them U and V,</span> <span m='350000'>that
  correspond to moving a bit in the x direction or in the y</span> <span m='354000'>direction?
  And then U cross V will be,</span> <span m='358000'>well, in terms of the magnitude
  of this guy will just be the</span> <span m='366000'>little piece of surface area,
  delta S.</span> <span m='371000'>And, in terms of direction, it will be normal to
  the</span> <span m='375000'>surface. Actually, I will get just delta</span> <span
  m='379000'>S times my normal vector. Well, up to sign because,</span> <span m='383000'>depending
  on whether I do U V or V U, I might get the normal</span> <span m='386000'>vector
  in the direction I want or in the opposite direction.</span> <span m='389000'>But
  we will take care of that later.</span> <span m='396000'>Let's find U and V. And,
  in case you have trouble</span> <span m='401000'>with that small picture, I have
  a better one here.</span> <span m='407000'>Let's keep it just in case this one gets
  really too cluttered.</span> <span m='413000'>It really represents the same thing.</span>
  <span m='417000'>Let's try to figure out these vectors U and V.</span> <span m='425000'>Vector
  U starts at the point x, y, f of x, y and it goes to --</span> <span m='433000'>Whereas,
  its head, well, I will have moved x by</span> <span m='439000'>delta x. So, x plus
  delta x and y</span> <span m='443000'>doesn't change. And, of course,</span> <span
  m='445000'>the z coordinate has to change. It becomes f of x plus delta x</span>
  <span m='451000'>and y. Now, how does f change if I</span> <span m='454000'>change
  x a little bit? Well, we have seen that it is</span> <span m='457000'>given by the
  partial derivative f sub x.</span> <span m='461000'>This is approximately equal
  to f of x, y plus delta x times f</span> <span m='467000'>sub x at the given point
  x, y.</span> <span m='471000'>I am not going to add it because the notation is already</span>
  <span m='476000'>long enough. That means my vector U,</span> <span m='479000'>well,
  approximately because I am using this linear</span> <span m='485000'>approximation,
  <delta x,</span> <span m='488000'>0, f sub x times delta x>. Is that OK with everyone?</span>
  <span m='495000'>Good. Now, what about V?</span> <span m='499000'>Well, V works
  the same way so I am not going to do all the</span> <span m='503000'>details. When
  I move from here to here x</span> <span m='507000'>doesn't change and y changes
  by delta y.</span> <span m='510000'>X component nothing happens. Y component changes
  by delta y.</span> <span m='519000'>What about the z component? Well, f changes
  by f sub y</span> <span m='522000'>times delta y. That is how f changes if I</span>
  <span m='531000'>increase y by delta y. I have my two sides.</span> <span m='539000'>Now
  I can take that cross-product.</span> <span m='543000'>Well, maybe I will first
  factor something out.</span> <span m='548000'>See, I can rewrite this as one, zero,
  f sub x times delta x.</span> <span m='553000'>And this one I will rewrite as zero,
  one, f sub y delta y.</span> <span m='560000'>And so now the cross-product, n hat
  delta S up to sign is</span> <span m='566000'>going to be U cross V. We will have
  to do the</span> <span m='571000'>cross-product, and we will have a delta x,</span>
  <span m='575000'>delta y coming out. I am just saving myself the</span> <span m='581000'>trouble
  of writing a lot of delta x's and delta y's,</span> <span m='587000'>but if you
  prefer you can just do directly this cross-product.</span> <span m='595000'>Let's
  compute this cross-product.</span> <span m='597000'>Well, the i component is zero
  minus f sub x.</span> <span m='603000'>The y component is going to be, well, f sub
  y minus zero but</span> <span m='607000'>with the minus sign in front of everything,
  so negative f sub y.</span> <span m='612000'>And the z component will be just one
  times delta x delta y.</span> <span m='620000'>Does that make sense? Yes.</span>
  <span m='625000'>Very good. And so now we shrink this</span> <span m='630000'>rectangle,
  we shrink delta x and delta y</span> <span m='632000'>to zero, that is how we get
  this formula</span> <span m='635000'>for n dS equals negative fx, negative fy,</span>
  <span m='638000'>one, dxdy. Well, plus/minus because it is</span> <span m='643000'>up
  to us to choose whether we want to take the normal vector</span> <span m='647000'>point
  up or down. See, if you take this</span> <span m='650000'>convention then the z
  component of n dS is positive.</span> <span m='655000'>That corresponds to normal
  vector pointing up.</span> <span m='659000'>If you take the opposite signs then
  the z component will be</span> <span m='662000'>negative. That means your normal
  vector</span> <span m='666000'>points down. This one is with n pointing up.</span>
  <span m='675000'>I mean when I say up, of course it is still</span> <span m='677000'>perpendicular
  to the surface. If the surface really has a big</span> <span m='681000'>slope then
  it is not really going to go all that much up,</span> <span m='686000'>but more
  up than down. OK.</span> <span m='691000'>That is how we get the formula. Any questions?</span>
  <span m='700000'>No. OK.</span> <span m='701000'>That is a really useful formula.</span>
  <span m='704000'>You don't really need to remember all the details of how</span>
  <span m='709000'>we got it, but please remember that formula.</span> <span m='714000'>Let's
  do an example, actually. Let's say we want to find the</span> <span m='726000'>flux
  of the vector field z times k,</span> <span m='728000'>so it is a vertical vector
  field,</span> <span m='732000'>through the portion of the paraboloid z equals x^2
  y^2 that</span> <span m='747000'>lives above the unit disk. What does that mean?</span>
  <span m='756000'>z = x^2 y^2. We have seen it many times.</span> <span m='759000'>It
  is this parabola and is pointing up.</span> <span m='763000'>Above the unit disk
  means I don't care about this infinite</span> <span m='767000'>surface. I will actually
  stop when I hit</span> <span m='772000'>a radius of one away from the z-axis.</span>
  <span m='776000'>And so now I have my vector field which is going to point</span>
  <span m='783000'>overall up because, well, it is z times k.</span> <span m='789000'>The
  more z is positive, the more your vector field goes</span> <span m='793000'>up.
  Of course, if z were negative</span> <span m='796000'>then it would point down,
  but it will live above.</span> <span m='800000'>Actually, a quick opinion poll.
  What do you think the flux</span> <span m='805000'>should be? Should it be positive,</span>
  <span m='808000'>zero, negative or we don't know?</span> <span m='812000'>I see
  some I don't know, I see some negative and I see</span> <span m='816000'>some positive.
  Of course, I didn't tell you</span> <span m='819000'>which way I am orienting my
  paraboloid.</span> <span m='822000'>So far both answers are correct. The only one
  that is probably</span> <span m='824000'>not correct is zero because, no matter
  which way you choose</span> <span m='827000'>to orient it you should get something.</span>
  <span m='829000'>It is not looking like it will be zero.</span> <span m='831000'>Let's
  say that I am going to do it with the normal pointing</span> <span m='840000'>upwards.
  Second chance.</span> <span m='846000'>I see some people changing back and forth
  from one and two.</span> <span m='851000'>Let's draw a picture. Which one is pointing
  upwards?</span> <span m='854000'>Well, let's look at the bottom point.</span> <span
  m='856000'>The normal vector pointing up, here we know what it means.</span> <span
  m='859000'>It is this guy. If you continue to follow your</span> <span m='862000'>normal
  vector, see, they are actually pointing</span> <span m='866000'>up and into the
  paraboloid. And I claim that the answer</span> <span m='870000'>should be positive
  because the vector field is crossing our</span> <span m='874000'>paraboliod going
  upwards, going from the outside out and</span> <span m='878000'>below to the inside
  and upside. So, in the direction that we</span> <span m='886000'>are counting positively.
  We will see how it turns out</span> <span m='895000'>when we do the calculation.
  We have to compute the integral</span> <span m='903000'>for flux. Double integral
  over a surface</span> <span m='908000'>of F dot n dS is going to be -- What are
  we going to do?</span> <span m='915000'>Well, F we said is <0,0, z>.</span> <span
  m='921000'>What is n dS. Well, let's use our brand new</span> <span m='925000'>formula.
  It says negative f sub x,</span> <span m='928000'>negative f sub y, one, dxdy.</span>
  <span m='931000'>What does little f in here? It is x^2 y^2.</span> <span m='938000'>When
  we are using this formula, we need to know what little x</span> <span m='942000'>stands
  for. It is whatever the formula is</span> <span m='947000'>for z as a function of
  x and y. We take x^2 y^2 and we take the</span> <span m='953000'>partial derivatives
  with minus signs.</span> <span m='957000'>We get negative 2x, negative 2y and one,</span>
  <span m='961000'>dxdy. Well, of course here it didn't</span> <span m='963000'>really
  matter because we are going to dot them with zero.</span> <span m='965000'>Actually,
  even if we had made a mistake we somehow wouldn't have</span> <span m='971000'>had
  to pay the price. But still.</span> <span m='975000'>We will end up with double
  integral on S of z dxdy.</span> <span m='982000'>Now, what do we do with that? Well,
  we have too many things.</span> <span m='985000'>We have to get rid of z. Let's
  use z equals x^2 y^2 once</span> <span m='1003000'>more. That becomes double integral
  of</span> <span m='1011000'>x^2 y^2 dxdy. And here, see,</span> <span m='1014000'>we
  are using the fact that we are only looking at things that</span> <span m='1017000'>are
  on the surface. It is not like in a triple</span> <span m='1019000'>integral. You
  could never do that because</span> <span m='1021000'>z, x and y are independent.
  Here they are related by the</span> <span m='1024000'>equation of a surface. If
  I sound like I am ranting,</span> <span m='1029000'>but I know from experience this
  is where one of the most sticky</span> <span m='1034000'>and tricky points is. OK.</span>
  <span m='1038000'>How will we actually integrate that?</span> <span m='1040000'>Well,
  now that we have just x and y, we should figure out what</span> <span m='1042000'>is
  the range for x and y. Well, the range for x and y is</span> <span m='1045000'>going
  to be the shadow of our region.</span> <span m='1047000'>It is going to be this
  unit disk.</span> <span m='1054000'>I can just do that for now. And this is finally
  where I</span> <span m='1063000'>have left the world of surface integrals to go
  back to a usual</span> <span m='1066000'>double integral. And now I have to set
  it up.</span> <span m='1069000'>Well, I can do it this way with dxdy, but it looks
  like there is</span> <span m='1072000'>a smarter thing to do. I am going to use
  polar</span> <span m='1075000'>coordinates. In fact, I am going to say this</span>
  <span m='1079000'>is double integral of r^2 times r dr d theta.</span> <span m='1083000'>I
  am on the unit disk so r goes zero to one, theta goes zero to</span> <span m='1087000'>2pi.
  And, if you do the calculation,</span> <span m='1092000'>you will find that this
  is going to be pi over two.</span> <span m='1099000'>Any questions about the example.
  Yes?</span> <span m='1106000'>How did I get this negative 2x and negative 2y?</span>
  <span m='1109000'>I want to use my formula for n dS.</span> <span m='1113000'>My
  surface is given by the graph of a function.</span> <span m='1116000'>It is the
  graph of a function x^2 y^2.</span> <span m='1120000'>I will use this formula that
  is up here.</span> <span m='1123000'>I will take the function x^2 y^2 and I will
  take its partial</span> <span m='1127000'>derivatives. If I take the partial of
  f,</span> <span m='1130000'>so x^2 y^2 with respect to x, I get 2x, so I put negative
  2x.</span> <span m='1135000'>And then the same thing, negative 2y,</span> <span
  m='1137000'>one, dxdy. Yes?</span> <span m='1141000'>Which k hat? Oh, you mean the
  vector field.</span> <span m='1144000'>It is a different part of the story.</span>
  <span m='1146000'>Whenever you do a surface integral for flux you have two</span>
  <span m='1150000'>parts of the story. One is the vector field whose</span> <span
  m='1153000'>flux you are taking. The other one is the surface</span> <span m='1157000'>for
  which you will be taking flux.</span> <span m='1161000'>The vector field only comes
  as this f in the notation,</span> <span m='1166000'>and everything else, the bounds
  in the double</span> <span m='1168000'>integral and the n dS, all come from the
  surface that</span> <span m='1172000'>we are looking at. Basically, in all of this</span>
  <span m='1176000'>calculation, this is coming from f equals zk.</span> <span m='1180000'>Everything
  else comes from the information paraboloid z = x^2</span> <span m='1187000'>y^2
  above the unit disk. In particular,</span> <span m='1191000'>if we wanted to now
  find the flux of any other vector field</span> <span m='1195000'>for the same paraboloid,
  well, all we would have to do</span> <span m='1198000'>is just replace this guy
  by whatever the new vector field</span> <span m='1202000'>is. We have learned how
  to set up</span> <span m='1205000'>flux integrals for this paraboloid.</span> <span
  m='1209000'>Not that you should remember this one by heart.</span> <span m='1210000'>I
  mean there are many paraboloids in life and other</span> <span m='1213000'>surfaces,
  too. It is better to remember the</span> <span m='1217000'>general method. Any other
  questions?</span> <span m='1222000'>No. OK.</span> <span m='1225000'>Let's see more
  ways of taking flux integrals.</span> <span m='1231000'>But, just to reassure you,
  at this point we have seen the</span> <span m='1233000'>most important ones. 90%
  of the problems that we</span> <span m='1236000'>will be looking at we can do with
  what we have seen so far in</span> <span m='1241000'>less time and this formula.
  Let's look a little bit at a</span> <span m='1249000'>more general situation. Let's
  say that my surface is so</span> <span m='1256000'>complicated that I cannot actually
  express z as a function</span> <span m='1260000'>of x and y, but let's say that
  I know how to parametize it.</span> <span m='1264000'>I have a parametric equation
  for my surface.</span> <span m='1266000'>That means I can express x, y and z in
  terms of any two</span> <span m='1271000'>parameter variables that might be relevant
  for me.</span> <span m='1276000'>If you want, this one here is a special case</span>
  <span m='1279000'>where you can parameterize things in terms of x and y as</span>
  <span m='1283000'>your two variables. How would you do it in the</span> <span m='1286000'>fully
  general case? In a way, that will answer your</span> <span m='1289000'>question
  that, I think one of you,</span> <span m='1290000'>I forgot, asked yesterday how
  would I do it in general?</span> <span m='1294000'>Is there a formula like M dx
  plus N dy?</span> <span m='1296000'>Well, that is going to be the general formula.</span>
  <span m='1299000'>And you will see that it is a little bit too complicated,</span>
  <span m='1302000'>so the really useful ones are actually the special ones.</span>
  <span m='1306000'>Let's say that we are given a parametric description -- -- of</span>
  <span m='1316000'>a surface S. That means we can describe S by</span> <span m='1321000'>formulas
  saying x is some function of two parameter</span> <span m='1325000'>variables. I
  am going to call them u and v.</span> <span m='1328000'>I hope you don't mind. You
  can call them t1 and t2.</span> <span m='1330000'>You can call them whatever you
  want.</span> <span m='1338000'>One of the basic properties of a surface is because
  I have only</span> <span m='1341000'>two independent directions to move on.</span>
  <span m='1343000'>I should be able to express x, y and z in terms of two</span>
  <span m='1346000'>variables. Now, let's say that I know how</span> <span m='1349000'>to
  do that. Or, maybe I should instead</span> <span m='1352000'>think of it in terms
  of a position vector if it helps you.</span> <span m='1355000'>That is just a vector
  with components <x,</span> <span m='1360000'>y, z> is given as a function of u and
  v.</span> <span m='1366000'>It works like a parametric curve but with two parameters.</span>
  <span m='1370000'>Now, how would we actually set up a flux integral on such a</span>
  <span m='1374000'>surface. Well, because we are locating</span> <span m='1377000'>ourselves
  in terms of u and v, we will end up with an integral</span> <span m='1381000'>du
  dv. We need to figure out how to</span> <span m='1386000'>express n dS in terms
  of du and dv.</span> <span m='1391000'>N dS should be something du dv. How do we
  do that?</span> <span m='1399000'>Well, we can use the same method that we have
  actually</span> <span m='1405000'>used over here. Because, if you think for a</span>
  <span m='1408000'>second, here we used, of course, a rectangle in the</span> <span
  m='1410000'>x, y plane and we lifted it to a parallelogram and so on.</span> <span
  m='1414000'>But more generally you can think what happens if I change u</span> <span
  m='1417000'>by delta u keeping v constant or the other way around?</span> <span
  m='1421000'>You will get some sort of mesh grid on your surface and you</span> <span
  m='1425000'>will look at a little parallelogram that is an</span> <span m='1428000'>elementary
  piece of that mesh and figure out what is its area</span> <span m='1432000'>and
  normal vector. Well, that will again be given</span> <span m='1437000'>by the cross-product
  of the two sides.</span> <span m='1441000'>Let's think a little bit about what happens
  when I move a</span> <span m='1447000'>little bit on my surface. I am taking this
  grid on my</span> <span m='1452000'>surface given by the u and v directions.</span>
  <span m='1456000'>And, if I take a piece of that corresponding to small changes</span>
  <span m='1465000'>delta u and delta v, what is going to be going on</span> <span
  m='1473000'>here? Well, I have to deal with two</span> <span m='1476000'>vectors,
  one corresponding to changing u, the other one</span> <span m='1479000'>corresponding
  to changing v. If I change u,</span> <span m='1482000'>how does my point change?
  Well, it is given by the</span> <span m='1486000'>derivative of this with respect
  to u.</span> <span m='1489000'>This vector here I will call, so the sides are given
  by,</span> <span m='1497000'>let me say, partial r over partial u times delta u.</span>
  <span m='1505000'>If you prefer, maybe I should write it as</span> <span m='1509000'>partial
  x over partial u times delta u.</span> <span m='1513000'>Well, it is just too boring
  to write.</span> <span m='1517000'>And so on. It means if I change u a little</span>
  <span m='1521000'>bit, keeping v constant, then how x changes is,</span> <span m='1524000'>given
  by partial x over partial u times delta u,</span> <span m='1526000'>same thing with
  y, same thing with z,</span> <span m='1528000'>and I am just using vector notation
  to do it this way.</span> <span m='1533000'>That is the analog of when I said delta
  r for line integrals</span> <span m='1541000'>along a curve, vector delta r is the
  velocity</span> <span m='1547000'>vector dr dt times delta t. Now, if I look at
  the other</span> <span m='1558000'>side -- Let me start again. I ran out of space.</span>
  <span m='1567000'>One side is partial r over partial u times delta u.</span> <span
  m='1572000'>And the other one would be partial r over partial v times</span> <span
  m='1577000'>delta v. Because that is how the</span> <span m='1579000'>position of
  your point changes if you just change u or v and</span> <span m='1584000'>not the
  other one. To find the surface element</span> <span m='1591000'>together with a
  normal vector, I would just take the</span> <span m='1600000'>cross-product between
  these guys.</span> <span m='1606000'>If you prefer, that is the cross-product of</span>
  <span m='1610000'>partial r over partial u with partial r over partial v,</span>
  <span m='1616000'>delta u delta v. And so n dS is this</span> <span m='1622000'>cross-product
  times du dv up to sign.</span> <span m='1631000'>It depends on which choice I make
  for my normal vector,</span> <span m='1647000'>of course. That, of course,</span>
  <span m='1652000'>is a slightly confusing equation to think of.</span> <span m='1655000'>A
  good exercise, if you want to really</span> <span m='1657000'>understand what is
  going on, try this in two good examples</span> <span m='1660000'>to look at. One
  good example to look at is</span> <span m='1663000'>the previous one. What is it?</span>
  <span m='1665000'>It is when u and v are just x and y.</span> <span m='1667000'>The
  parametric equations are just x equals x,</span> <span m='1671000'>y equals y and
  z is f of x, y.</span> <span m='1674000'>You should end up with the same formula
  that we had over there.</span> <span m='1679000'>And you should see why because
  both of them are given by a</span> <span m='1683000'>cross-product. The other case
  you can look at</span> <span m='1686000'>just to convince yourselves even further.</span>
  <span m='1688000'>We don't need to do that because we have seen the formula</span>
  <span m='1692000'>before, but in the case of a sphere we have seen the formula</span>
  <span m='1697000'>for n and for dS separately. We know what n dS are in terms</span>
  <span m='1702000'>of d phi, d theta. Well, you could parametize a</span> <span m='1706000'>sphere
  in terms of phi and theta.</span> <span m='1708000'>Namely, the formulas would be
  x equals a sine phi cosine theta,</span> <span m='1713000'>y equals a sign phi sine
  theta, z equals a cosine phi.</span> <span m='1718000'>The formulas for circle coordinates
  setting Ro equals a</span> <span m='1722000'>. That is a parametric equation</span>
  <span m='1724000'>for the sphere. And then, if you try to use</span> <span m='1727000'>this
  formula here, you should end up with the same</span> <span m='1730000'>things we
  have already seen for n dS,</span> <span m='1732000'>just with a lot more pain to
  actually get there because</span> <span m='1737000'>cross-product is going to be
  a bit complicated.</span> <span m='1740000'>But we are seeing all of these formulas
  all fitting together.</span> <span m='1743000'>Somehow it is always the same question.</span>
  <span m='1745000'>We just have different angles of attack on this general</span>
  <span m='1750000'>problem. Questions?</span> <span m='1758000'>No. OK.</span> <span
  m='1760000'>Let's look at yet another last way of finding n dS.</span> <span m='1770000'>And
  then I promise we will switch to something else because</span> <span m='1776000'>I
  can feel that you are getting a bit overwhelmed for all these</span> <span m='1782000'>formulas
  for n dS. What happens very often is we</span> <span m='1787000'>don't actually
  know how to parametize our surface.</span> <span m='1791000'>Maybe we don't know
  how to solve for z as a function of x</span> <span m='1794000'>and y, but our surface
  is given by some equation.</span> <span m='1798000'>And so what that means is actually
  maybe what we know is</span> <span m='1805000'>not really these kinds of formulas,
  but maybe we know a</span> <span m='1812000'>normal vector. And I am going to call
  this one</span> <span m='1817000'>capital N because I don't even need it to be a
  unit vector.</span> <span m='1822000'>You will see. It can be a normal vector of</span>
  <span m='1827000'>any length you want to the surfaces.</span> <span m='1833000'>Why
  would we ever know a normal vector?</span> <span m='1835000'>Well, for example,
  if our surface is a plane,</span> <span m='1839000'>a slanted plane given by some
  equation, ax by cz = d.</span> <span m='1843000'>Well, you know the normal vector.</span>
  <span m='1844000'>It is . Of course, you could solve for</span> <span m='1848000'>z
  and then go back to that case, which is why I said that one is</span> <span m='1852000'>very
  useful. But you can also just stay with</span> <span m='1855000'>a normal vector.
  Why else would you know a</span> <span m='1858000'>normal vector? Well, let's say
  that you know</span> <span m='1861000'>an equation that is of a form g of x, y,
  z equals zero.</span> <span m='1865000'>Well, then you know that the gradient of
  g is perpendicular</span> <span m='1868000'>to the level surface. Let me just give
  you two</span> <span m='1874000'>examples. If you have a plane,</span> <span m='1879000'>ax
  by cz = d, then the normal vector would</span> <span m='1884000'>just be <a, b,
  c>.</span> <span m='1888000'>If you have a surface S given by an equation,</span>
  <span m='1894000'>g(x, y, z) = 0, then you can take a normal</span> <span m='1900000'>vector
  to be the gradient of g. We have seen that the gradient</span> <span m='1906000'>is
  perpendicular to the level surface.</span> <span m='1909000'>Now, of course, we
  don't necessarily have to</span> <span m='1911000'>follow what is going to come.
  Because, if we could solve for</span> <span m='1915000'>z, then we might be better
  off doing what we did over there.</span> <span m='1919000'>But let's say that we
  want to do it this.</span> <span m='1922000'>What can we do? Well, I am going to
  give you</span> <span m='1926000'>another way to think geometrically about n dS.</span>
  <span m='1960000'>Let's start by thinking about the slanted plane.</span> <span
  m='1963000'>Let's say that my surface is just a slanted plane.</span> <span m='1967000'>My
  normal vector would be maybe somewhere here.</span> <span m='1972000'>And let's
  say that I am going to try -- I need to get some</span> <span m='1975000'>handle
  on how to set up my integrals,</span> <span m='1977000'>so maybe I am going to express
  things in terms of x and y.</span> <span m='1980000'>I have my coordinates, and
  I will try to use x and y.</span> <span m='1985000'>Then I would like to relate
  delta S or dS to the area in the</span> <span m='1991000'>x y plane. That means
  I want maybe to look</span> <span m='1994000'>at the projection of this guy onto
  a horizontal plane.</span> <span m='1999000'>Let's squish it horizontally. Then
  you have here another area.</span> <span m='2011000'>The guy on the slanted plane,
  let's call that delta S.</span> <span m='2015000'>And let's call this guy down here
  delta A.</span> <span m='2018000'>And delta A would become ultimately maybe delta
  x,</span> <span m='2022000'>delta y or something like that. The question is how
  do we find</span> <span m='2027000'>the conversion rate between these two areas?</span>
  <span m='2031000'>I mean they are not the same. Visually, I hope it is clear to</span>
  <span m='2033000'>you that if my plane is actually horizontal then,</span> <span
  m='2036000'>of course, they are the same. But the more slanted it becomes</span>
  <span m='2040000'>the more delta A becomes smaller than delta S.</span> <span m='2044000'>If
  you buy land and it is on the side of a cliff,</span> <span m='2049000'>well, whether
  you look at it on a map or whether you look at it</span> <span m='2052000'>on the
  actual cliff, the area is going to be very</span> <span m='2055000'>different. I
  am not sure if that is a wise</span> <span m='2058000'>thing to do if you want to
  build a house there,</span> <span m='2062000'>but I bet you can get really cheap
  land.</span> <span m='2066000'>Anyway, delta S versus delta A depends on how slanted
  things</span> <span m='2071000'>are. And let's try to make that more</span> <span
  m='2074000'>precise by looking at the angel that our plane makes with the</span>
  <span m='2081000'>horizontal direction. Let's call this angle alpha,</span> <span
  m='2087000'>the angle that our plane makes with the horizontal direction.</span>
  <span m='2093000'>See, it is all coming together. The first unit about</span> <span
  m='2097000'>cross-products, normal vectors and so on is</span> <span m='2103000'>actually
  useful now. I claim that the surface</span> <span m='2109000'>element is related
  to the area in the plane by delta A equals</span> <span m='2116000'>delta S times
  the cosine of alpha.</span> <span m='2119000'>Why is that? Well, let's look at this
  small</span> <span m='2124000'>rectangle with one horizontal side and one slanted
  side.</span> <span m='2127000'>When you project this side does not change, but this
  side gets</span> <span m='2133000'>shortened by a factor of cosine alpha.</span>
  <span m='2137000'>Whatever this length was, this length here is that one</span>
  <span m='2141000'>times cosine alpha. That is why the area gets</span> <span m='2144000'>shrunk
  by cosine alpha. In one direction nothing</span> <span m='2148000'>happens. In the
  other direction you</span> <span m='2152000'>squish by cosine alpha. What that means
  is that,</span> <span m='2159000'>well, we will have to deal with this.</span> <span
  m='2165000'>And, of course, the one we will care about</span> <span m='2168000'>actually
  is delta S expressed in terms of delta A.</span> <span m='2171000'>But what are
  we going to do with this cosine?</span> <span m='2173000'>It is not very convenient
  to have a cosine left in here.</span> <span m='2175000'>Remember, the angle between
  two planes is the same thing as the</span> <span m='2179000'>angle between the normal
  vectors.</span> <span m='2181000'>If you want to see this angle alpha elsewhere,</span>
  <span m='2183000'>what you can do is you can just take the vertical direction.</span>
  <span m='2187000'>Let's take k. Then here we have our angle</span> <span m='2198000'>alpha
  again. In particular,</span> <span m='2203000'>cosine of alpha, I can get, well,</span>
  <span m='2206000'>we know how to find the angle between two vectors.</span> <span
  m='2210000'>If we have our normal vector N, we will do N dot k,</span> <span m='2217000'>and
  we will divide by length N, length k.</span> <span m='2222000'>Well, length k is
  one. That is one easy guy.</span> <span m='2226000'>That is how we find the angle.
  Now I am going to say,</span> <span m='2232000'>well, delta S is going to be one
  over cosine alpha delta A.</span> <span m='2241000'>And I can rewrite that as length
  of N divided by N dot k</span> <span m='2256000'>times delta A. Now, let's multiply
  that by the</span> <span m='2262000'>unit normal vector. Because what we are about
  is</span> <span m='2268000'>not so much dS but actually n dS.</span> <span m='2272000'>N
  delta S will be, I am just going to multiply by</span> <span m='2284000'>N. Well,
  let's think for a second.</span> <span m='2287000'>What happens if I take a unit
  normal N and I multiply it by</span> <span m='2291000'>the length of my other normal
  big N?</span> <span m='2294000'>Well, I get big N again. This is a normal vector
  of the</span> <span m='2299000'>same length as N, well, up to sign.</span> <span
  m='2302000'>The only thing I don't know is whether this guy will be going</span>
  <span m='2307000'>in the same direction as big N or in the opposite direction.</span>
  <span m='2312000'>Say that, for example, my capital N has,</span> <span m='2315000'>I
  don't know, length three for example.</span> <span m='2319000'>Then the normal unit
  vector might be this guy,</span> <span m='2323000'>in which case indeed three times
  little n will be big n.</span> <span m='2327000'>Or it might be this one in which
  case three times little n</span> <span m='2332000'>will be negative big N. But up
  to sign it is N.</span> <span m='2338000'>And then I will have N over N dot k delta
  A.</span> <span m='2342000'>And so the final formula, the one that we care about
  in</span> <span m='2347000'>case you don't really like my explanations of how we
  get</span> <span m='2351000'>there, is that N dS is plus or minus N</span> <span
  m='2359000'>over N dot k dx dy. That one is actually kind of</span> <span m='2367000'>useful
  so let's box it. Now,</span> <span m='2371000'>just in case you are wondering, of
  course, if you didn't want</span> <span m='2375000'>to project to x, y,</span> <span
  m='2376000'>you would have maybe preferred to project to say the plane of a</span>
  <span m='2379000'>blackboard, y, z,</span> <span m='2380000'>well, you can do the
  same thing. To express n dS in terms of dy</span> <span m='2385000'>dz you do the
  same argument. Simply, the only thing that</span> <span m='2389000'>changes, instead
  of using the vertical vector k,</span> <span m='2391000'>you use the normal vector
  i. So you would be doing N over N</span> <span m='2396000'>dot i dy dz. The same
  thing.</span> <span m='2398000'>So just keep an open mind that this also works with
  other</span> <span m='2404000'>variables. Anyway, that is how you can</span> <span
  m='2409000'>basically project the vectors of this area element onto the x,</span>
  <span m='2417000'>y plane in a way. Let's look at the special case</span> <span
  m='2423000'>just to see how this fits with stuff we have seen before.</span> <span
  m='2429000'>Let's do a special example where our surface is given by</span> <span
  m='2437000'>the equation z minus f of x, y equals zero.</span> <span m='2444000'>That
  is a strange way to write the equation.</span> <span m='2446000'>z equals f of x,
  y. That we saw before.</span> <span m='2450000'>But now it looks like some function
  of x,</span> <span m='2453000'>y, z equals zero. Let's try to use this new</span>
  <span m='2457000'>method. Let's call this guy g(x, y, z).</span> <span m='2465000'>Well,
  now let's look at the normal vector.</span> <span m='2467000'>The normal vector
  would be the gradient of g,</span> <span m='2470000'>you see. What is the gradient
  of this</span> <span m='2473000'>function? The gradient of g -- Well,</span> <span
  m='2477000'>partial g, partial x, that is just negative partial</span> <span m='2482000'>f,
  partial x. The y component,</span> <span m='2485000'>partial g, partial y is going
  to be negative f sub y,</span> <span m='2492000'>and g sub z is just one. Now, if
  you take N over N dot k</span> <span m='2502000'>dx dy, well, it looks like it is
  going</span> <span m='2506000'>to be negative f sub x, negative f sub y,</span>
  <span m='2510000'>one divided by -- Well, what is N dot k?</span> <span m='2513000'>If
  you dot that with k you will get just one,</span> <span m='2517000'>so I am not
  going to write it, dx dy.</span> <span m='2521000'>See, that is again our favorite
  formula.</span> <span m='2525000'>This one is actually more general because you
  don't need</span> <span m='2532000'>to solve for z, but if you cannot solve for
  z</span> <span m='2538000'>then it is the same as before. I think that is enough
  formulas</span> <span m='2548000'>for n dS. After spending a lot of time</span>
  <span m='2554000'>telling you how to compute surface integrals,</span> <span m='2561000'>now
  I am going to try to tell you how to avoid computing them.</span> <span m='2571000'>And
  that is called the divergence theorem.</span> <span m='2585000'>And we will see
  the proof and everything and applications on</span> <span m='2589000'>Tuesday, but
  I want to at least the theorem and see how it works</span> <span m='2592000'>in
  one example. It is also known as the</span> <span m='2595000'>Gauss-Green theorem
  or just the Gauss theorem,</span> <span m='2599000'>depending in who you talk to.
  The Green here is the same</span> <span m='2604000'>Green as in Green's theorem,
  because somehow that is a space</span> <span m='2608000'>version of Green's theorem.
  What does it say?</span> <span m='2611000'>It is 3D analog of Green for flux.</span>
  <span m='2623000'>What it says is if S is a closed surface -- Remember,</span> <span
  m='2627000'>it is the same as with Green's theorem, we need to have</span> <span
  m='2632000'>something that is completely enclosed.</span> <span m='2636000'>You
  have a surface and there is somehow no gaps in it.</span> <span m='2640000'>There
  is no boundary to it. It is really completely</span> <span m='2646000'>enclosing
  a region in space that I will call D.</span> <span m='2657000'>And I need to choose
  my orientation.</span> <span m='2659000'>The orientation that will work for this
  theorem is choosing the</span> <span m='2669000'>normal vector to point outwards.
  N needs to be outwards.</span> <span m='2683000'>That is one part of the puzzle.
  The other part is a vector</span> <span m='2686000'>field. I need to have a vector
  field</span> <span m='2691000'>that is defined and differentiable -- -- everywhere</span>
  <span m='2698000'>in D, so same instructions as usual.</span> <span m='2704000'>Then
  I don't have actually to compute the flux integral.</span> <span m='2712000'>Double
  integral of f dot n dS of a closed surface S.</span> <span m='2717000'>I am going
  to put a circle just to remind you it is has got to</span> <span m='2719000'>be
  a closed surface. It is just a notation to remind</span> <span m='2722000'>us closed
  surface. I can replace that by the</span> <span m='2726000'>triple integral of a
  region inside of divergence of F dV.</span> <span m='2732000'>Now, I need to tell
  you what the divergence of a 3D vector</span> <span m='2736000'>field is. Well,
  you will see that it is</span> <span m='2739000'>not much harder than in the 2D
  case.</span> <span m='2741000'>What you do is just -- Say that your vector field
  has components</span> <span m='2758000'>P, Q and R. Then you will take P sub x Q</span>
  <span m='2766000'>sub y R sub z. That is the definition.</span> <span m='2770000'>It
  is pretty easy to remember. You take the x component</span> <span m='2773000'>partial
  respect to S plus partial respect to y over y</span> <span m='2778000'>component
  plus partial respect to z of the z component.</span> <span m='2783000'>For example,
  last time we saw that the flux</span> <span m='2793000'>of the vector field zk through
  a sphere of radius a was</span> <span m='2802000'>four-thirds pi a cubed by computing
  the surface integral.</span> <span m='2813000'>Well, if we do it more efficiently
  now by Green's</span> <span m='2816000'>theorem, we are going to use Green's theorem
  for this sphere</span> <span m='2819000'>because we are doing the whole sphere.</span>
  <span m='2822000'>It is fine. It is a closed surface.</span> <span m='2824000'>We
  couldn't do it for, say, the hemisphere or</span> <span m='2825000'>something like
  that. Well, for a hemisphere we would</span> <span m='2829000'>need to add maybe
  the flat face of a bottom or something like</span> <span m='2835000'>that. Green's
  theorem says that our</span> <span m='2840000'>flux integral can actually be replaced
  by the triple integral</span> <span m='2848000'>over the solid bowl of radius a
  of the divergence of zk dV.</span> <span m='2856000'>But now what is the divergence
  of this field?</span> <span m='2860000'>Well, you have zero, zero, z so you get
  zero plus</span> <span m='2868000'>zero plus one. It looks like it will be one.</span>
  <span m='2872000'>If you do the triple integral of 1dV, you will get just the</span>
  <span m='2879000'>volume -- -- of the region inside, which is four-thirds by</span>
  <span m='2886000'>a cubed. And so it was no accident.</span> <span m='2889000'>In
  fact, before that we looked at also xi yj zk and we found</span> <span m='2893000'>three
  times the volume. That is because the divergence</span> <span m='2897000'>of that
  field was actually three.</span> <span m='2899000'>Very quickly, let me just say
  what this means</span> <span m='2902000'>physically. Physically, see,</span> <span
  m='2904000'>this guy on the left is the total amount of stuff that goes</span> <span
  m='2909000'>out of the region per unit time. I want to figure out how much</span>
  <span m='2914000'>stuff comes out of there. What does the divergence mean?</span>
  <span m='2917000'>The divergence means it measures how much the flow is</span> <span
  m='2921000'>expanding things. It measures how much,</span> <span m='2923000'>I said
  that probably when we were trying to understand 2D</span> <span m='2926000'>divergence.
  It measures the amount of</span> <span m='2929000'>sources or sinks that you have
  inside your fluid.</span> <span m='2934000'>Now it becomes commonsense. If you take
  a region of space,</span> <span m='2937000'>the total amount of water that flows
  out of it is the total</span> <span m='2941000'>amount of sources that you have
  in there minus the sinks.</span> <span m='2945000'>I mean, in spite of this commonsense
  explanation,</span> <span m='2948000'>we are going to see how to prove this.</span>
  <span m='2950000'>And we will see how it works and what it says.</span> </p>
