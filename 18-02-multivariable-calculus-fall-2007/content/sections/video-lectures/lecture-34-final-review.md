  </p><p><span m='23000'>OK, so anyway, let's get started.</span> </p><p><span m='27000'>So,
  the first unit of the class,</span> <span m='31000'>so basically I'm going to go
  over the first half of the class</span> <span m='33000'>today, and the second half
  of the</span> <span m='36000'>class on Tuesday just because we have to start somewhere.</span>
  </p><p><span m='41000'>So, the first things that we learned about in this class
  were</span> <span m='48000'>vectors, and how to do dot-product of vectors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='54000'>So, remember the formula that A dot B is the sum of ai times
  bi.</span> </p><p><span m='61000'>And, geometrically, it's length A times length
  B</span> <span m='65000'>times the cosine of the angle between them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='68000'>And, in particular, we can use this to detect when</span> <span m='71000'>two
  vectors are perpendicular. That's when their dot product</span> <span m='74000'>is
  zero. And, we can use that to measure</span> <span m='77000'>angles between vectors
  by solving for cosine in this.</span> </p><p><span m='81000'>Hopefully, at this
  point, this looks a lot easier than it</span> <span m='85000'>used to a few months
  ago. So, hopefully at this point,</span> <span m='88000'>everyone has this kind
  of formula memorized and has some</span> <span m='92000'>reasonable understanding
  of that.</span> </p><p><span m='95000'>But, if you have any questions, now is the
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='101000'>No? Good.</span> </p><p><span m='105000'>Next
  we learned how to also do cross product of vectors in</span> <span m='115000'>space
  -- -- and remember, we saw how to use that to find</span> <span m='126000'>area
  of, say, a triangle or a parallelogram</span> <span m='130000'>in space because
  the length of the cross product is equal to</span> <span m='134000'>the area of
  a parallelogram formed by the vectors a and b.</span> </p><p><span m='137000'>And,
  we can also use that to find a vector perpendicular to</span> <span m='145000'>two
  given vectors, A and B.</span> </p><p><span m='148000'>And so, in particular, that
  comes in handy when we are</span> <span m='153000'>looking for the equation of a
  plane because we've seen -- So,</span> <span m='162000'>the next topic would be
  equations of planes.</span> </p><p><span m='169000'>And, we've seen that when you
  put the equation of a plane in</span> <span m='175000'>the form ax by cz = d, well,
  <a,</span> <span m='179000'>b, c> in there is actually the normal vector to the
  plane,</span> <span m='183000'>or some normal vector to the plane.</span> </p><p><span
  m='187000'>So, typically, we use cross product to find</span> <span m='191000'>plane
  equations. OK, is that still reasonably</span> <span m='196000'>familiar to everyone?
  Yes, very good.</span> </p><p><span m='201000'>OK, we've also seen how to look at
  equations of lines,</span> <span m='206000'>and those were of a slightly different
  nature because we've</span> <span m='211000'>been doing them as parametric equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='215000'>So, typically we had equations of a form, maybe x equals
  some</span> <span m='222000'>constant times t, y equals constant plus constant</span>
  <span m='227000'>times t. z equals constant plus constant</span> <span m='233000'>times
  t where these terms here correspond to some point on the</span> <span m='242000'>line.
  And, these coefficients here</span> <span m='246000'>correspond to a vector parallel
  to the line.</span> </p><p><span m='251000'>That's the velocity of the moving point
  on the line.</span> </p><p><span m='259000'>And, well, we've learned in particular
  how</span> <span m='263000'>to find where a line intersects a plane by plugging
  in the</span> <span m='269000'>parametric equation into the equation of a plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='274000'>We've learned more general things about parametric</span>
  <span m='283000'>equations of curves. So, there are these infamous</span> <span
  m='288000'>problems in particular where you have these rotating wheels and</span>
  <span m='291000'>points on them, and you have to figure out,</span> <span m='293000'>what's
  the position of a point? And, the general principle of</span> <span m='297000'>those
  is that you want to decompose the position vector</span> <span m='301000'>into a
  sum of simpler things. OK, so if you have a point on a</span> <span m='305000'>wheel
  that's itself moving and something else,</span> <span m='308000'>then you might
  want to first figure out the position of a</span> <span m='311000'>center of a wheel
  than find the angle by which the wheel has</span> <span m='314000'>turned, and then
  get to the position of</span> <span m='318000'>a moving point by adding together
  simpler vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='323000'>So, the general principle is really
  to try to find one</span> <span m='327000'>parameter that will let us understand
  what has happened,</span> <span m='330000'>and then decompose the motion into a
  sum of simpler effect.</span> </p><p><span m='336000'>So, we want to decompose the
  position vector into a sum of</span> <span m='354000'>simpler vectors. OK, so maybe
  now we are getting</span> <span m='362000'>a bit out of some people's comfort zone,</span>
  <span m='365000'>but hopefully it's not too bad. Do you have any general</span>
  <span m='372000'>questions about how one would go about that, or,</span> <span m='380000'>yes?
  Sorry? What about it?</span> </p><p><span m='384000'>Parametric descriptions of
  a plane,</span> <span m='385000'>so we haven't really done that because you would
  need two</span> <span m='388000'>parameters to parameterize a plane just because
  it's a two</span> <span m='391000'>dimensional object. So, we have mostly focused
  on</span> <span m='395000'>the use of parametric equations just for one dimensional</span>
  <span m='400000'>objects, lines, and curves.</span> </p><p><span m='402000'>So,
  you won't need to know about</span> <span m='405000'>parametric descriptions of
  planes on a final,</span> <span m='407000'>but if you really wanted to, you would
  think of defining a</span> <span m='411000'>point on a plane as starting from some
  given point.</span> </p><p><span m='415000'>Then you have two vectors given on the
  plane.</span> </p><p><span m='417000'>And then, you would add a multiple of each
  of these</span> <span m='420000'>vectors to your starting point. But see, the difficulty
  is to</span> <span m='424000'>convert from that to the usual equation of a plane,</span>
  <span m='428000'>you would still have to go back to this cross product method,</span>
  <span m='431000'>and so on. So, it is possible to represent</span> <span m='435000'>a
  plane, or, in general, a surface in parametric form.</span> </p><p><span m='439000'>But,
  very often, that's not so useful.</span> </p><p><span m='443000'>Yes? How do you
  parametrize an</span> <span m='448000'>ellipse in space? Well, that depends on how
  it's</span> <span m='451000'>given to you. But, OK, let's just do an</span> <span
  m='454000'>example. Say that I give you an ellipse</span> <span m='458000'>in space
  as maybe the more, well, one exciting way to</span> <span m='462000'>parameterize
  an ellipse in space is maybe the intersection of a</span> <span m='465000'>cylinder
  with a slanted plane. That's the kind of situations</span> <span m='469000'>where
  you might end up with an ellipse.</span> </p><p><span m='472000'>OK, so if I tell
  you that maybe I'm intersecting a cylinder with</span> <span m='478000'>equation
  x squared plus y squared equals a squared with a</span> <span m='483000'>slanted
  plane to get, I messed up my picture,</span> <span m='489000'>to get this ellipse
  of intersection,</span> <span m='493000'>so, of course you'd need the equation of
  a plane.</span> </p><p><span m='494000'>And, let's say that this plane is maybe
  given to you.</span> </p><p><span m='498000'>Or, you can switch it to form where
  you can get z as a</span> <span m='503000'>function of x and y. So, maybe it would
  be z equals,</span> <span m='509000'>I've already used a; I need to use a new letter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='513000'>Let's say c1x c2y plus d, whatever, something like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='521000'>So, what I would do is first I would look at what my ellipse</span>
  <span m='525000'>does in the directions in which I understand it the best.</span>
  </p><p><span m='529000'>And, those directions would be probably the xy plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='533000'>So, I would look at the xy coordinates.</span> </p><p><span
  m='536000'>Well, if I look at it from above xy, my ellipse looks like</span> <span
  m='542000'>just a circle of radius a. So, if I'm only concerned with</span> <span
  m='546000'>x and y, presumably I can just do it the usual way for a</span> <span
  m='550000'>circle. x equals a cosine t.</span> </p><p><span m='553000'>y equals
  a sine t, OK? And then, z would end up being</span> <span m='560000'>just, well,
  whatever the value of z is to be on the slanted</span> <span m='564000'>plane above
  a given xy position. So, in fact,</span> <span m='569000'>it would end up being
  ac1 cosine t plus ac2 sine t plus d,</span> <span m='578000'>I guess. OK, that's
  not a particularly</span> <span m='582000'>elegant parameterization, but that's
  the kind of thing</span> <span m='584000'>you might end up with. Now, in general,</span>
  <span m='587000'>when you have a curve in space, it would rarely be the case</span>
  <span m='590000'>that you have to get a parameterization from scratch</span> <span
  m='593000'>unless you are already being told information about how it</span> <span
  m='596000'>looks in one of the coordinate planes,</span> <span m='598000'>this kind
  of method. Or, at least you'd have a lot</span> <span m='603000'>of information
  that would quickly reduce to a plane</span> <span m='607000'>problem somehow. Of
  course, I could also just</span> <span m='611000'>give you some formulas and let
  you figure out what's going on.</span> </p><p><span m='616000'>But, in general,
  we've done more stuff with</span> <span m='621000'>plane curves. With plane curves,</span>
  <span m='625000'>certainly there's interesting things with all sorts of</span> <span
  m='629000'>mechanical gadgets that we can study.</span> </p><p><span m='632000'>OK,
  any other questions on that? No?</span> </p><p><span m='639000'>OK, so let me move
  on a bit and point out that with parametric</span> <span m='645000'>equations, we've
  looked also at things like velocity and</span> <span m='651000'>acceleration. So,
  the velocity vector is the</span> <span m='655000'>derivative of a position vector
  with respect to time.</span> </p><p><span m='659000'>And, it's not to be confused
  with speed, which is the</span> <span m='664000'>magnitude of v. So, the velocity
  vector is</span> <span m='668000'>going to be always tangent to the curve.</span>
  </p><p><span m='672000'>And, its length will be the speed.</span> </p><p><span m='674000'>That's
  the geometric interpretation.</span> </p><p><span m='692000'>So, just to provoke
  you, I'm going to write,</span> <span m='697000'>again, that formula that was that
  v equals T hat ds dt.</span> </p><p><span m='703000'>What do I mean by that? If
  I have a curve,</span> <span m='706000'>and I'm moving on the curve, well, I have
  the unit tangent</span> <span m='711000'>vector which I think at the time I used
  to draw in blue.</span> </p><p><span m='716000'>But, blue has been abolished since
  then.</span> </p><p><span m='719000'>So, I'm going to draw it in red. OK, so that's
  a unit vector</span> <span m='724000'>that goes along the curve, and then the actual
  velocity is</span> <span m='729000'>going to be proportional to that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='731000'>And, what's the length? Well, it's the speed.</span> </p><p><span m='735000'>And,
  the speed is how much arc length on the curve I go per</span> <span m='739000'>unit
  time, which is why I'm writing ds dt.</span> </p><p><span m='742000'>That's another
  guy. That's another of these guys</span> <span m='750000'>for the speed, OK?</span>
  </p><p><span m='754000'>And, we've also learned about acceleration,</span> <span
  m='761000'>which is the derivative of velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='767000'>So,
  it's the second derivative of a position vector.</span> </p><p><span m='770000'>And,
  as an example of the kinds of manipulations we can do,</span> <span m='774000'>in
  class we've seen Kepler's second law,</span> <span m='776000'>which explains how
  if the acceleration is parallel to the</span> <span m='783000'>position vector,
  then r cross v is going to be</span> <span m='788000'>constant, which means that
  the motion</span> <span m='790000'>will be in an plane, and you will sweep area
  at a</span> <span m='793000'>constant rate. So now, that is not in itself a</span>
  <span m='796000'>topic for the exam, but the kinds of methods of</span> <span m='799000'>differentiating
  vector quantities,</span> <span m='802000'>applying the product rule to take the
  derivative of a dot or</span> <span m='805000'>cross product and so on are definitely
  fair game.</span> </p><p><span m='808000'>I mean, we've seen those on the first
  exam.</span> </p><p><span m='810000'>They were there, and most likely they will
  be on</span> <span m='815000'>the final. OK, so I mean that's the extent</span>
  <span m='819000'>to which Kepler's law comes up, only just knowing the general</span>
  <span m='824000'>type of manipulations and proving things with vector</span> <span
  m='827000'>quantities, but not again the actual</span> <span m='832000'>Kepler's
  law itself. I skipped something.</span> </p><p><span m='838000'>I skipped matrices,
  determinants,</span> <span m='848000'>and linear systems. OK, so we've seen how
  to</span> <span m='858000'>multiply matrices, and how to write linear systems</span>
  <span m='864000'>in matrix form. So, remember,</span> <span m='868000'>if you have
  a 3x3 linear system in the usual sense,</span> <span m='875000'>so, you can write
  this in a matrix</span> <span m='882000'>form where you have a 3x3 matrix and you
  have an unknown column</span> <span m='892000'>vector. And, their matrix product</span>
  <span m='897000'>should be some given column vector.</span> </p><p><span m='901000'>OK,
  so if you don't remember how to multiply matrices,</span> <span m='904000'>please
  look at the notes on that again.</span> </p><p><span m='907000'>And, also you should
  remember how to invert a matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='912000'>So, how did we invert
  matrices? Let me just remind you very</span> <span m='922000'>quickly. So, I should
  say 2x2 or 3x3</span> <span m='930000'>matrices. Well, you need to have a square</span>
  <span m='933000'>matrix to be able to find an inverse.</span> </p><p><span m='935000'>The
  method doesn't work, doesn't make sense.</span> </p><p><span m='937000'>Otherwise,
  then the concept of inverse doesn't work.</span> </p><p><span m='940000'>And, if
  it's larger than 3x3, then we haven't seen that.</span> </p><p><span m='943000'>So,
  let's say that I have a 3x3 matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='950000'>What I will do
  is I will start by forming the matrix of minors.</span> </p><p><span m='960000'>So,
  remember that minors, so, each entry is a 2x2</span> <span m='969000'>determinant
  in the case of a 3x3 matrix formed by deleting one</span> <span m='980000'>row and
  one column. OK, so for example,</span> <span m='986000'>to get the first minor,
  especially in the upper left</span> <span m='990000'>corner, I would delete the
  first row, the first column.</span> </p><p><span m='994000'>And, I would be left
  with this 2x2 determinant.</span> </p><p><span m='996000'>I take this times that
  minus this times that.</span> </p><p><span m='998000'>I get a number that gives
  my first minor.</span> </p><p><span m='1001000'>And then, same with the others.
  Then, I flip signs according to</span> <span m='1009000'>this checkerboard pattern,
  and that gives me the matrix of</span> <span m='1016000'>cofactors. OK, so all it
  means is I'm just</span> <span m='1020000'>changing the signs of these four entries
  and leaving the others</span> <span m='1026000'>alone. And then, I take the transpose</span>
  <span m='1030000'>of that. So, that means I read it</span> <span m='1033000'>horizontally
  and write it down vertically.</span> </p><p><span m='1036000'>I swept the rows and
  the columns.</span> </p><p><span m='1039000'>And then, I divide by the inverse.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1043000'>Well, I divide by the determinant of the initial</span>
  <span m='1048000'>matrix. OK, so, of course,</span> <span m='1050000'>this is kind
  of very theoretical, and I write it like</span> <span m='1052000'>this. Probably
  it makes more sense to</span> <span m='1054000'>do it on an example. I will let
  you work out</span> <span m='1057000'>examples, or bug your recitation instructors
  so that they do one</span> <span m='1062000'>on Monday if you want to see that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1064000'>It's a fairly straightforward method.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1067000'>You just have to remember the steps.</span> </p><p><span m='1070000'>But,
  of course, there's one condition,</span> <span m='1072000'>which is that the determinant
  of a matrix has to be nonzero.</span> </p><p><span m='1077000'>So, in fact, we've
  seen that,</span> <span m='1079000'>oh, there is still one board left.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1083000'>We've seen that a matrix is invertible -- -- exactly when</span> <span
  m='1092000'>its determinant is not zero. And, if that's the case,</span> <span m='1099000'>then
  we can solve the linear system, AX equals B by just</span> <span m='1104000'>setting
  X equals A inverse B. That's going to be the only</span> <span m='1110000'>solution
  to our linear system. Otherwise, well,</span> <span m='1118000'>AX equals B has
  either no solution, or infinitely many</span> <span m='1132000'>solutions. Yes?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1141000'>The determinant of a matrix real quick?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1144000'>Well, I can do it that quickly unless I start waving my hands</span>
  <span m='1148000'>very quickly, but remember we've seen that</span> <span m='1152000'>you
  have a matrix, a 3x3 matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='1155000'>Its determinant will
  be obtained by doing an expansion</span> <span m='1158000'>with respect to, well,
  your favorite.</span> </p><p><span m='1160000'>But usually, we are doing it with
  respect to</span> <span m='1162000'>the first row. So, we take this entry and</span>
  <span m='1166000'>multiply it by that determinant. Then, we take that entry,</span>
  <span m='1171000'>multiply it by that determinant but put a minus sign.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1175000'>And then, we take that entry and multiply it by this</span> <span m='1178000'>determinant
  here, and we put a plus sign for</span> <span m='1181000'>that. OK, so maybe I should
  write it</span> <span m='1184000'>down. That's actually the same</span> <span m='1186000'>formula
  that we are using for cross products.</span> </p><p><span m='1188000'>Right, when
  we do cross products, we are doing an</span> <span m='1190000'>expansion with respect
  to the first row.</span> </p><p><span m='1193000'>That's a special case. OK, I mean,
  do you still want</span> <span m='1197000'>to see it in more details, or is that
  OK?</span> </p><p><span m='1199000'>Yes? That's correct.</span> </p><p><span m='1212000'>So,
  if you do an expansion with respect to any row or column,</span> <span m='1216000'>then
  you would use the same signs that are in this</span> <span m='1219000'>checkerboard
  pattern there. So, if you did an expansion,</span> <span m='1222000'>actually, so
  indeed, maybe I should say,</span> <span m='1225000'>the more general way to determine
  it is you take your</span> <span m='1228000'>favorite row or column, and you just
  multiply the</span> <span m='1231000'>corresponding entries by the corresponding
  cofactors.</span> </p><p><span m='1234000'>So, the signs are plus or minus depending
  on what's in that</span> <span m='1237000'>diagram there. Now, in practice,</span>
  <span m='1238000'>in this class, again, all we need is to do it</span> <span m='1241000'>with
  respect to the first row. So, don't worry about it too</span> <span m='1246000'>much.
  OK, so, again,</span> <span m='1248000'>the way that we've officially seen it in
  this class is just if</span> <span m='1251000'>you have a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3,
  c1, c2, c3,</span> <span m='1259000'>so if the determinant is a1 times b2 b3, c2
  c3,</span> <span m='1266000'>minus a2 b1 b3 c1 c3 plus a3 b1 b2 c1 c2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1276000'>And, this minus is here basically because of the minus</span> <span
  m='1280000'>in the diagram up there. But, that's all we need to know.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1287000'>Yes? How do you tell the difference</span> <span m='1292000'>between
  infinitely many solutions or no solutions?</span> </p><p><span m='1294000'>That's
  a very good question. So, in full generality,</span> <span m='1297000'>the answer
  is we haven't quite seen a systematic method.</span> </p><p><span m='1300000'>So,
  you just have to try solving and see if you can find</span> <span m='1303000'>a
  solution or not. So, let me actually explain</span> <span m='1306000'>that more
  carefully. So, what happens to these two</span> <span m='1311000'>situations when
  a is invertible or not?</span> </p><p><span m='1316000'>So, remember, in the linear
  system,</span> <span m='1317000'>you can think of a linear system as asking you
  to find the</span> <span m='1321000'>intersection between three planes because each
  equation is</span> <span m='1325000'>the equation of a plane. So, Ax = B for a 3x3
  system</span> <span m='1332000'>means that x should be in the intersection of three
  planes.</span> </p><p><span m='1344000'>And then, we have two cases. So, the case
  where the system</span> <span m='1348000'>is invertible corresponds to the general
  situation where your</span> <span m='1353000'>three planes somehow all just intersect
  in one point.</span> </p><p><span m='1357000'>And then, the situation where the
  determinant,</span> <span m='1361000'>that's when the determinant is not zero, you
  get just one</span> <span m='1365000'>point. However, sometimes it will</span> <span
  m='1368000'>happen that all the planes are parallel to the same direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1374000'>So, determinant a equals zero means the three planes are</span>
  <span m='1384000'>parallel to a same vector. And, in fact,</span> <span m='1391000'>you
  can find that vector explicitly because that vector</span> <span m='1394000'>has
  to be perpendicular to all the normals.</span> </p><p><span m='1397000'>So, at some
  point we saw other subtle things about how to find</span> <span m='1402000'>the
  direction of this line that's parallel to all the</span> <span m='1406000'>planes.
  So, now, this can happen either</span> <span m='1410000'>with all three planes containing
  the same line.</span> </p><p><span m='1414000'>You know, they can all pass through
  the same axis.</span> </p><p><span m='1416000'>Or it could be that they have somehow
  shifted with respect to</span> <span m='1419000'>each other. And so, it might look
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1424000'>Then, the last one is actually in front
  of that.</span> </p><p><span m='1426000'>So, see, the lines of intersections between
  two of the</span> <span m='1432000'>planes, so, here they all pass through</span>
  <span m='1435000'>the same line, and here, instead,</span> <span m='1437000'>they
  intersect in one line here,</span> <span m='1440000'>one line here, and one line
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='1443000'>And, there's no triple intersection.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1446000'>So, in general, we haven't really seen how to</span> <span
  m='1448000'>decide between these two cases. There's one important situation</span>
  <span m='1453000'>where we have seen we must be in the first case that when we have</span>
  <span m='1460000'>a homogeneous system, so that means if the right hand</span> <span
  m='1466000'>side is zero, then,</span> <span m='1471000'>well, x equals zero is
  always a solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1481000'>It's called the trivial solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1483000'>It's the obvious one, if you want.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1490000'>So, you know that, and why is that?</span> </p><p><span m='1493000'>Well,
  that's because all of your planes have to pass through</span> <span m='1497000'>the
  origin. So, you must be in this case if</span> <span m='1500000'>you have a noninvertible
  system where the right hand side is</span> <span m='1504000'>zero. So, in that case,</span>
  <span m='1505000'>if the right hand side is zero, there's two cases.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1508000'>Either the matrix is invertible. Then, the only solution is the</span>
  <span m='1512000'>trivial one. Or, if a matrix is not</span> <span m='1514000'>invertible,
  then you have infinitely many solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='1519000'>If B is
  not zero, then we haven't really seen how</span> <span m='1523000'>to decide. We've
  just seen how to decide</span> <span m='1527000'>between one solution or zero,infinitely
  many,</span> <span m='1530000'>but not how to decide between these last two cases.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1533000'>Yes? I think in principle,</span> <span m='1542000'>you
  would be able to, but that's, well,</span> <span m='1544000'>I mean, that's a slightly
  counterintuitive way of doing</span> <span m='1548000'>it. I think it would probably
  work.</span> </p><p><span m='1550000'>Well, I'll let you figure it out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1555000'>OK, let me move on to the second unit, maybe,</span> <span m='1559000'>because
  we've seen a lot of stuff, or was there a quick</span> <span m='1563000'>question
  before that? OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1601000'>OK, so what was the second part
  of the class about?</span> </p><p><span m='1604000'>Well, hopefully you kind of
  vaguely remember that it was</span> <span m='1607000'>about functions of several
  variables and their partial</span> <span m='1610000'>derivatives. OK, so the first
  thing that</span> <span m='1615000'>we've seen is how to actually view a function
  of two variables</span> <span m='1624000'>in terms of its graph and its contour
  plot.</span> </p><p><span m='1632000'>So, just to remind you very</span> <span m='1635000'>quickly,
  if I have a function of two</span> <span m='1637000'>variables, x and y, then the
  graph will be just the</span> <span m='1641000'>surface given by the equation z
  equals f of xy.</span> </p><p><span m='1645000'>So, for each x and y, I plot a point
  at height given</span> <span m='1648000'>with the value of the a function.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1650000'>And then, the contour plot will be the topographical map
  for</span> <span m='1654000'>this graph. It will tell us,</span> <span m='1657000'>what
  are the various levels in there?</span> </p><p><span m='1661000'>So, what it amounts
  to is we slice the graph by horizontal</span> <span m='1666000'>planes, and we get
  a bunch of curves which are the points at</span> <span m='1670000'>given height
  on the plot. And, so we get all of these</span> <span m='1676000'>curves, and then
  we look at them from above, and that gives us</span> <span m='1684000'>this map
  with a bunch of curves on it.</span> </p><p><span m='1689000'>And, each of them
  has a number next to it which tells us the</span> <span m='1693000'>value of a function
  there. And, from that map, we can,</span> <span m='1696000'>of course, tell things
  about where we might be able to find</span> <span m='1699000'>minima or maxima of
  our function,</span> <span m='1702000'>and how it varies with respect to x or y
  or actually in any</span> <span m='1710000'>direction at a given point. So, now,
  the next thing that</span> <span m='1720000'>we've learned about is partial derivatives.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1729000'>So, for a function of two variables, there would be two
  of</span> <span m='1732000'>them. There's f sub x which is</span> <span m='1734000'>partial
  f partial x, and f sub y which is partial f</span> <span m='1738000'>partial y.
  And, in terms of a graph,</span> <span m='1740000'>they correspond to slicing by
  a plane that's parallel to one of</span> <span m='1744000'>the coordinate planes,
  so that we either keep x</span> <span m='1747000'>constant, or keep y constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1750000'>And, we look at the slope of a graph to see the rate of
  change</span> <span m='1754000'>of f with respect to one variable only when we hold
  the</span> <span m='1757000'>other one constant. And so, we've seen in</span> <span
  m='1761000'>particular how to use that in various places,</span> <span m='1765000'>but,
  for example, for linear approximation we've</span> <span m='1769000'>seen that the
  change in f is approximately equal to f sub x</span> <span m='1774000'>times the
  change in x plus f sub y times the change in y.</span> </p><p><span m='1780000'>So,
  you can think of f sub x and f sub y as telling you how</span> <span m='1785000'>sensitive
  the value of f is to changes in x and y.</span> </p><p><span m='1789000'>So, this
  linear approximation also tells us about the tangent</span> <span m='1799000'>plane
  to the graph of f. In fact, when we turn this into</span> <span m='1807000'>an equality,
  that would mean that we replace f by the tangent</span> <span m='1816000'>plane.
  We've also learned various ways</span> <span m='1819000'>of, before I go on, I should
  say,</span> <span m='1821000'>of course, we've seen these also for functions of
  three</span> <span m='1824000'>variables, right? So, we haven't seen how to plot</span>
  <span m='1828000'>them, and we don't really worry about that too much.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1832000'>But, if you have a function of three variables,</span> <span m='1837000'>you
  can do the same kinds of manipulations.</span> </p><p><span m='1842000'>So, we've
  learned about differentials and chain rules,</span> <span m='1849000'>which are
  a way of repackaging these partial derivatives.</span> </p><p><span m='1857000'>So,
  the differential is just, by definition,</span> <span m='1860000'>this thing called
  df which is f sub x times dx plus f sub y</span> <span m='1865000'>times dy. And,
  what we can do with it is</span> <span m='1869000'>just either plug values for changes
  in x and y,</span> <span m='1874000'>and get approximation formulas, or we can look
  at this in a</span> <span m='1877000'>situation where x and y will depend on something
  else,</span> <span m='1881000'>and we get a chain rule. So, for example,</span>
  <span m='1886000'>if f is a function of t time, for example, and so is y,</span>
  <span m='1892000'>then we can find the rate of change of f with respect to t</span>
  <span m='1896000'>just by dividing this by dt. So, we get df dt equals f sub x</span>
  <span m='1903000'>dx dt plus f sub y dy dt. We can also get other chain</span> <span
  m='1908000'>rules, say, if x and y depend on more</span> <span m='1911000'>than
  one variable, if you have a change of</span> <span m='1914000'>variables, for example,</span>
  <span m='1915000'>x and y are functions of two other guys that you call u and</span>
  <span m='1918000'>v, then you can express dx and dy</span> <span m='1921000'>in
  terms of du and dv, and plugging into df you will</span> <span m='1925000'>get the
  manner in which f depends on u and v.</span> </p><p><span m='1928000'>So, that will
  give you formulas for partial f partial u,</span> <span m='1931000'>and partial
  f partial v. They look just like these guys</span> <span m='1934000'>except there's
  a lot of curly d's instead of straight ones,</span> <span m='1939000'>and u's and
  v's in the denominators.</span> </p><p><span m='1941000'>OK, so that lets us understand
  rates of change.</span> </p><p><span m='1946000'>We've also seen yet another way
  to package partial derivatives</span> <span m='1951000'>into not a differential,
  but instead,</span> <span m='1953000'>a vector. That's the gradient vector,</span>
  <span m='1957000'>and I'm sure it was quite mysterious when we first saw it,</span>
  <span m='1961000'>but hopefully by now, well, it should be less</span> <span m='1965000'>mysterious.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1987000'>OK, so we've learned about the gradient vector which is
  del f</span> <span m='1994000'>is a vector whose components are just the partial
  derivatives.</span> </p><p><span m='2001000'>So, if I have a function of just two
  variables,</span> <span m='2006000'>then it's just this. And,</span> <span m='2009000'>so
  one observation that we've made is that if you look at a</span> <span m='2017000'>contour
  plot of your function, so maybe your function is zero,</span> <span m='2024000'>one,
  and two, then the gradient vector is</span> <span m='2027000'>always perpendicular
  to the contour plot,</span> <span m='2029000'>and always points towards higher ground.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2034000'>OK, so the reason for that was that if you take any direction,</span>
  <span m='2042000'>you can measure the directional derivative,</span> <span m='2044000'>which
  means the rate of change of f in that direction.</span> </p><p><span m='2052000'>So,
  given a unit vector, u, which represents some</span> <span m='2060000'>direction,
  so for example let's say I</span> <span m='2064000'>decide that I want to go in
  this direction,</span> <span m='2069000'>and I ask myself, how quickly will f change
  if I</span> <span m='2072000'>start from here and I start moving towards that direction?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2076000'>Well, the answer seems to be, it will start to increase
  a</span> <span m='2078000'>bit, and maybe at some point later on something else
  will</span> <span m='2081000'>happen. But at first, it will increase.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2085000'>So, the directional derivative is</span> <span m='2088000'>what we've
  called f by ds in the direction of this unit vector,</span> <span m='2093000'>and
  basically the only thing we know to be able to compute it,</span> <span m='2096000'>the
  only thing we need is that it's the dot product between the</span> <span m='2100000'>gradient
  and this vector u hat. In particular,</span> <span m='2102000'>the directional derivatives
  in the direction of I hat or j hat</span> <span m='2105000'>are just the usual partial
  derivatives.</span> </p><p><span m='2107000'>That's what you would expect. OK, and
  so now you see in</span> <span m='2112000'>particular if you try to go in a direction
  that's perpendicular</span> <span m='2115000'>to the gradient, then the directional
  derivative</span> <span m='2118000'>will be zero because you are moving on the level
  curve.</span> </p><p><span m='2121000'>So, the value doesn't change, OK?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2127000'>Questions about that? Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='2145000'>Yeah,
  so let's see, so indeed to look at more</span> <span m='2149000'>recent things,
  if you are taking the flux</span> <span m='2152000'>through something given by an
  equation,</span> <span m='2155000'>so, if you have a surface given by an equation,</span>
  <span m='2159000'>say, f equals one. So, say that you have a surface</span> <span
  m='2165000'>here or a curve given by an equation,</span> <span m='2168000'>f equals
  constant, then the normal vector to the</span> <span m='2174000'>surface is given
  by taking the gradient of f.</span> </p><p><span m='2179000'>And that is, in general,
  not a unit normal</span> <span m='2182000'>vector. Now, if you wanted the unit</span>
  <span m='2184000'>normal vector to compute flux, then you would just scale this</span>
  <span m='2188000'>guy down to unit length, OK?</span> </p><p><span m='2190000'>So,
  if you wanted a unit normal, that would be the</span> <span m='2193000'>gradient
  divided by its length. However, for flux,</span> <span m='2197000'>that's still
  of limited usefulness because you would</span> <span m='2200000'>still need to know
  about ds. But, remember,</span> <span m='2202000'>we've seen a formula for flux
  in terms of a non-unit normal</span> <span m='2206000'>vector, and n over n dot
  kdxdy. So, indeed, this is how you</span> <span m='2212000'>could actually handle
  calculations of flux through</span> <span m='2218000'>pretty much anything. Any
  other questions about that?</span> </p><p><span m='2229000'>OK, so let me continue
  with a couple more things we need to,</span> <span m='2239000'>so, we've seen how
  to do min/max problems,</span> <span m='2245000'>in particular, by looking at critical
  points.</span> </p><p><span m='2253000'>So, critical points, remember, are the points
  where</span> <span m='2255000'>all the partial derivatives are zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2257000'>So, if you prefer, that's where the gradient</span> <span m='2260000'>vector
  is zero. And, we know how to decide</span> <span m='2265000'>using the second derivative
  test whether a critical point is</span> <span m='2272000'>going to be a local min,
  a local max,</span> <span m='2277000'>or a saddle point. Actually, we can't always
  quite</span> <span m='2282000'>decide because, remember, we look at the second</span>
  <span m='2285000'>partials, and we compute this quantity ac minus b squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2288000'>And, if it happens to be zero, then actually we can't</span>
  <span m='2290000'>conclude. But, most of the time we can</span> <span m='2293000'>conclude.
  However, that's not all we need</span> <span m='2296000'>to look for an absolute
  global maximum or minimum.</span> </p><p><span m='2300000'>For that, we also need
  to check the boundary points,</span> <span m='2303000'>or look at the behavior of
  a function, at infinity.</span> </p><p><span m='2307000'>So, we also need to check
  the values of f at the boundary of</span> <span m='2318000'>its domain of definition
  or at infinity.</span> </p><p><span m='2326000'>Just to give you an example from
  single variable calculus,</span> <span m='2328000'>if you are trying to find the
  minimum and the maximum of f of</span> <span m='2331000'>x equals x squared, well,
  you'll find quickly that</span> <span m='2335000'>the minimum is at zero where x
  squared is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2337000'>If you are looking for the maximum,
  you better not just</span> <span m='2340000'>look at the derivative because you
  won't find it that way.</span> </p><p><span m='2342000'>However, if you think for
  a second, you'll see that if x</span> <span m='2345000'>becomes very large, then
  the function increases to</span> <span m='2348000'>infinity. And, similarly,</span>
  <span m='2350000'>if you try to find the minimum and the maximum of x squared</span>
  <span m='2354000'>when x varies only between one and two,</span> <span m='2357000'>well,
  you won't find the critical point,</span> <span m='2359000'>but you'll still find
  that the smallest value of x squared is</span> <span m='2361000'>when x is at one,
  and the largest is at x equals</span> <span m='2364000'>two. And, all this business
  about</span> <span m='2366000'>boundaries and infinity is exactly the same stuff,</span>
  <span m='2369000'>but with more than one variable.</span> </p><p><span m='2371000'>It's
  just the story that maybe the minimum and the maximum are</span> <span m='2377000'>not
  quite visible, but they are at the edges of a</span> <span m='2382000'>domain we
  are looking at. Well, in the last three</span> <span m='2388000'>minutes, I will
  just write down a couple more things we've seen</span> <span m='2395000'>there.
  So, how to do max/min problems</span> <span m='2400000'>with non-independent variables
  -- So, if your variables are</span> <span m='2408000'>related by some condition,
  g equals some constant.</span> </p><p><span m='2415000'>So, then we've seen the
  method of Lagrange multipliers.</span> </p><p><span m='2425000'>OK, and what this
  method says is that we should solve the</span> <span m='2431000'>equation gradient
  f equals some unknown scalar lambda times the</span> <span m='2436000'>gradient,
  g. So, that means each partial,</span> <span m='2439000'>f sub x equals lambda g
  sub x and so on,</span> <span m='2443000'>and of course we have to keep in mind
  the constraint equation</span> <span m='2448000'>so that we have the same number
  of equations as the number of</span> <span m='2453000'>unknowns because you have
  a new unknown here.</span> </p><p><span m='2457000'>And, the thing to remember is
  that you have to be careful that</span> <span m='2464000'>the second derivative
  test does not apply in this situation.</span> </p><p><span m='2473000'>I mean, this
  is only in the case of independent variables.</span> </p><p><span m='2476000'>So,
  if you want to know if something is a maximum or a</span> <span m='2478000'>minimum,
  you just have to use common</span> <span m='2480000'>sense or compare the values
  of a function at the various points</span> <span m='2484000'>you found. Yes?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2489000'>Will we actually have to calculate?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2494000'>Well, that depends on what the problem asks you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2498000'>It might ask you to just set up the equations,</span> <span m='2500000'>or
  it might ask you to solve them.</span> </p><p><span m='2501000'>So, in general,
  solving might be difficult,</span> <span m='2504000'>but if it asks you to do it,
  then it means it shouldn't be</span> <span m='2507000'>too hard. I haven't written
  the final</span> <span m='2510000'>yet, so I don't know what it will be, but it
  might be an easy</span> <span m='2514000'>one. And, the last thing we've seen</span>
  <span m='2520000'>is constrained partial derivatives.</span> </p><p><span m='2526000'>So,
  for example, if you have a relation between</span> <span m='2532000'>x, y, and z,
  which are constrained to be a</span> <span m='2535000'>constant, then the notion
  of partial f</span> <span m='2540000'>partial x takes several meanings.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2544000'>So, just to remind you very quickly, there's the formal</span> <span
  m='2552000'>partial, partial f, partial x, which means x</span> <span m='2558000'>varies.
  Y and z are held constant.</span> </p><p><span m='2563000'>And, we forget the constraint.
  This is not compatible with a</span> <span m='2568000'>constraint, but we don't
  care. So, that's the guy that we</span> <span m='2571000'>compute just from the
  formula for f ignoring the constraints.</span> </p><p><span m='2574000'>And then,
  we have the partial f, partial x with y held</span> <span m='2581000'>constant,
  which means y held constant.</span> </p><p><span m='2586000'>X varies, and now we
  treat z as a dependent variable.</span> </p><p><span m='2595000'>It varies with
  x and y according to whatever is needed</span> <span m='2600000'>so that this constraint
  keeps holding.</span> </p><p><span m='2604000'>And, similarly, there's partial f
  partial x</span> <span m='2609000'>with z held constant, which means that,</span>
  <span m='2613000'>now, y is the dependent variable.</span> </p><p><span m='2618000'>And,
  the way in which we compute these,</span> <span m='2619000'>we've seen two methods
  which I'm not going to tell you now</span> <span m='2622000'>because otherwise we'll
  be even more over time.</span> </p><p><span m='2625000'>But, we've seen two methods
  for computing these based on either</span> <span m='2628000'>the chain rule or on
  differentials,</span> <span m='2630000'>solving and substituting into differentials.</span>
