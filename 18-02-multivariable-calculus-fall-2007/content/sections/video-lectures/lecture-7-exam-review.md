  <span m='23000'>Let me just tell you first about the list of topics.</span> <span
  m='29000'>Basically, the list of topics is simple.</span> <span m='35000'>It is
  everything. I mean, everything we have seen</span> <span m='42000'>so far is on
  the exam. But let me just remind you of</span> <span m='48000'>the main topics that
  we have seen.</span> <span m='52000'>First of all, we learned about vectors,</span>
  <span m='58000'>how to use them, and dot-product.</span> <span m='63000'>At this
  point, you probably should know that</span> <span m='67000'>the dot-product of two
  vectors is obtained by summing products</span> <span m='73000'>of components. And
  geometrically it is the</span> <span m='79000'>length of A times the length of B
  times the cosine of the angle</span> <span m='89000'>between them. And, in particular,</span>
  <span m='94000'>we can use dot-product to measure angles by solving for</span> <span
  m='101000'>cosine theta in this equality. And most importantly to detect</span>
  <span m='109000'>whether two vectors are perpendicular to each other.</span> <span
  m='114000'>Two vectors are perpendicular when their dot-product is zero.</span>
  <span m='120000'>Any questions about that? No.</span> <span m='127000'>Is everyone
  reasonably happy with dot-product by now?</span> <span m='135000'>I see a stunned
  silence. Nobody happy with dot-product</span> <span m='139000'>so far? OK.</span>
  <span m='148000'>If you want to look at Practice 1A, a good example of a typical</span>
  <span m='156000'>problem with dot-product would be problem 1.</span> <span m='161000'>Let's
  see. We are going to go over the</span> <span m='163000'>practice exam when I am
  done writing this list of topics.</span> <span m='166000'>I think probably we actually
  will skip this problem because I</span> <span m='169000'>think most of you know
  how to do it.</span> <span m='171000'>And if not then you should run for help from
  me or from your</span> <span m='177000'>recitation instructor to figure out how
  to do it.</span> <span m='182000'>The second topic that we saw was cross-product.</span>
  <span m='190000'>When you have two vectors in space, you can just form that</span>
  <span m='199000'>cross-product by computing its determinant.</span> <span m='205000'>So,
  implicitly, we should also know about</span> <span m='211000'>determinants. By that
  I mean two by two and</span> <span m='215000'>three by three. Don't worry about
  larger ones,</span> <span m='218000'>even if you are interested, they won't be on
  the test.</span> <span m='223000'>And applications of cross-product,</span> <span
  m='229000'>for example, finding the area of a triangle</span> <span m='235000'>or
  a parallelogram in space. If you have a triangle in space</span> <span m='244000'>with
  sides A and B then its area is one-half of the length of A</span> <span m='250000'>cross
  B. Because the length of A cross B</span> <span m='254000'>is length A, length B
  sine theta, which is the same as the</span> <span m='259000'>area of the parallelogram
  formed by these two vectors.</span> <span m='264000'>And the other application of
  cross-product is to find a</span> <span m='268000'>vector that's perpendicular to
  two given vectors.</span> <span m='272000'>In particular, to find the vector that
  is</span> <span m='276000'>normal to a plane and then find the equation of a plane.</span>
  <span m='282000'>Another application is finding the normal vector to a plane and</span>
  <span m='297000'>using that finding the equation of a plane.</span> <span m='308000'>Basically,
  remember, to find the equation of a</span> <span m='316000'>plane, ax by cz = d,
  what you need is the normal</span> <span m='323000'>vector to the plane. And the
  components of the</span> <span m='329000'>normal vector are exactly the coefficients
  that go into this.</span> <span m='332000'>And we have seen an argument for why
  that happens to be the</span> <span m='338000'>case. To find a normal vector to
  a</span> <span m='340000'>plane typically what we will do is take two vectors that
  lie in</span> <span m='344000'>the plane and will take their cross-product.</span>
  <span m='347000'>And the cross-product will automatically be perpendicular</span>
  <span m='354000'>to both of them. We are going to see an example</span> <span m='359000'>of
  that when we look at problem 5 in practice 1A.</span> <span m='364000'>I think we
  will try to do that one.</span> <span m='372000'>Another application, well, we will
  just mention it</span> <span m='377000'>as a topic that goes along with this one.</span>
  <span m='381000'>We have seen also about equations of lines and how to</span> <span
  m='394000'>find where a line intersects a plane.</span> <span m='403000'>Just to
  refresh your memories, the equation of a line,</span> <span m='406000'>well, we
  will be looking at parametric equations.</span> <span m='410000'>To know the parametric
  equation of a line, we need to know a</span> <span m='414000'>point on the line
  and we need to know a vector that is parallel</span> <span m='419000'>to the line.
  And, if we know a point on the</span> <span m='423000'>line and a vector along the
  line,</span> <span m='426000'>then we can express the parametric equations for the</span>
  <span m='431000'>motion of a point that is moving on the line.</span> <span m='436000'>Actually,
  starting at point, at time zero,</span> <span m='439000'>and moving with velocity
  v.</span> <span m='458000'>To put things in symbolic form, you will get a position
  of that</span> <span m='464000'>point by starting with a position of time zero and
  adding</span> <span m='468000'>t times the vector v. It gives you x,</span> <span
  m='473000'>y and z in terms of t. And that is how we represent</span> <span m='480000'>lines.
  We will look at problem 5 in a</span> <span m='486000'>bit, but any general questions
  about these topics?</span> <span m='495000'>No. Do you have a question?</span> <span
  m='500000'>Do we have to know Taylor series?</span> <span m='506000'>That is a good
  question. No, not on the exam.</span> <span m='514000'>[APPLAUSE] Taylor series
  are something you</span> <span m='516000'>should be aware of, generally speaking.</span>
  <span m='518000'>It will be useful for you in real life,</span> <span m='520000'>probably
  not when you go to the supermarket,</span> <span m='524000'>but if you solve engineering
  problems you will need Taylor</span> <span m='528000'>series. It would be good not
  to forget</span> <span m='532000'>them entirely, but on the 18.02 exams they</span>
  <span m='538000'>probably won't be there. Let me continue with more</span> <span
  m='543000'>topics. And then we can see if you can</span> <span m='546000'>think
  of other topics that should or should not be on the</span> <span m='551000'>exam.
  Third topics would be matrices,</span> <span m='562000'>linear systems, inverting
  matrices.</span> <span m='574000'>I know that most of you that have calculators
  that can invert</span> <span m='577000'>matrices, but still you are expected at
  this point to know</span> <span m='580000'>how to do it by hand. If you have looked
  at the</span> <span m='582000'>practice tests, both of them have a problem</span>
  <span m='584000'>that asks you to invert a matrix or at least do part of it.</span>
  <span m='587000'>And so it is very likely that tomorrow there will be a problem</span>
  <span m='593000'>like that as well. In general, when a kind of</span> <span m='597000'>problem
  is on both practice tests it's a good indication</span> <span m='600000'>that it
  might be there also on the actual exam.</span> <span m='604000'>Unfortunately, not
  with the same matrix so you</span> <span m='608000'>cannot learn the answer by heart.</span>
  <span m='612000'>Another thing that we have learned about,</span> <span m='617000'>well,
  I should say this is going to be problem 3 on the</span> <span m='624000'>test and
  will on the practice test.</span> <span m='629000'>On the actual test, too, I think,</span>
  <span m='633000'>actually. Anyway, we will come back to it</span> <span m='637000'>later.
  A couple of things that you</span> <span m='639000'>should remember. If you have
  a system of the</span> <span m='642000'>form AX equals B then there are two cases.</span>
  <span m='646000'>If a determinant of A is not zero then that means you can</span>
  <span m='651000'>compute the inverse matrix and you can just solve by taking A</span>
  <span m='656000'>inverse times B. And the other case is when the</span> <span m='662000'>determinant
  of A is zero, and there is either no solution</span> <span m='671000'>or there is
  infinitely many solutions.</span> <span m='678000'>In particular, if you know that
  there is a</span> <span m='680000'>solution, for example,</span> <span m='681000'>if
  B is zero there always is an obvious solution,</span> <span m='684000'>X equals
  zero, then you will actually have</span> <span m='688000'>infinitely many. In general,
  we don't really</span> <span m='690000'>know how to tell whether it is no solution
  or infinitely many.</span> <span m='703000'>Questions about that? Yes?</span> <span
  m='712000'>Will we have to know how to rotate vectors and so on?</span> <span m='718000'>Not
  in general, but you might still want to</span> <span m='721000'>remember how to
  rotate a vector in a plane by 90 degrees because</span> <span m='724000'>that has
  been useful when we have done problems about</span> <span m='727000'>parametric
  equations, which is what I am coming to</span> <span m='730000'>next. What we have
  seen about</span> <span m='732000'>rotation matrices, that was the homework part
  B</span> <span m='735000'>problem, you are not supposed to</span> <span m='737000'>remember
  by heart everything that was in part B of your</span> <span m='741000'>homework.
  It is a good idea to have some</span> <span m='744000'>vague knowledge because it
  is useful culture,</span> <span m='747000'>I would say, useful background for later
  in</span> <span m='748000'>your lives, but I won't ask you by heart to</span> <span
  m='753000'>know what is the formation for a rotation matrix.</span> <span m='760000'>And
  then we come to, last by not least,</span> <span m='769000'>the problem of finding
  parametric equations.</span> <span m='780000'>And, in particular, possibly by decomposing
  the</span> <span m='783000'>position vector into a sum of simpler vectors.</span>
  <span m='786000'>You have seen quite an evil exam of that on the last problem</span>
  <span m='793000'>set with this picture that maybe by now you have had some</span>
  <span m='799000'>nightmares about. Anyway, the one on the exam</span> <span m='803000'>will
  certainly be easier than that.</span> <span m='807000'>But, as you have seen --
  I mean, you should know,</span> <span m='816000'>basically, how to analyze a motion
  that is</span> <span m='820000'>being described to you and express it in terms of
  vectors</span> <span m='824000'>and then figure out what the parametric equation
  will be.</span> <span m='828000'>Now, again, it won't be as complicated on the exam
  as the</span> <span m='832000'>one in the problem set. But there are a couple of
  those</span> <span m='837000'>on the practice exam, so that gives you an idea of</span>
  <span m='841000'>what is realistically expected of you.</span> <span m='844000'>And
  now once we have parametric equations for motion,</span> <span m='849000'>so that
  means when we know how to find the position vector as a</span> <span m='853000'>function
  of a parameter maybe of time,</span> <span m='855000'>then we have seen also about
  velocity and acceleration,</span> <span m='864000'>which the vector is obtained
  by taking the first and second</span> <span m='868000'>derivatives of a position
  vector.</span> <span m='871000'>And so one topic that I will add in there as well
  is somehow</span> <span m='881000'>how to prove things about motions by differentiating</span>
  <span m='890000'>vector identities. One example of that,</span> <span m='895000'>for
  example, is when we try to look at</span> <span m='898000'>Kepler's law in class
  last time. We look at Kepler's second law</span> <span m='903000'>of planetary motion,
  and we reduced it to a</span> <span m='906000'>calculation about a derivative of
  the cross-product R cross v.</span> <span m='910000'>Now, on the exam you don't
  need to know the details of Kepler's</span> <span m='914000'>law, but you need to
  be able to</span> <span m='916000'>manipulate vector quantities a bit in the way
  that we did.</span> <span m='922000'>And so on practice exam 1A, you actually have
  a variety of</span> <span m='927000'>problems on this topics because you have problems
  two,</span> <span m='930000'>four and six, all about parametric motions.</span>
  <span m='936000'>Probably tomorrow there will not be three distinct problems</span>
  <span m='942000'>about parametric motions, but maybe a couple of them.</span> <span
  m='948000'>I think that is basically the list of topics.</span> <span m='951000'>Anybody
  spot something that I have forgotten to put on the</span> <span m='954000'>exam
  or questions about something that should or should</span> <span m='958000'>not be
  there? You go first.</span> <span m='963000'>Yeah? How about parametrizing weird</span>
  <span m='971000'>trigonometric functions? I am not sure what you mean by</span>
  <span m='978000'>that. Well, parametric curves,</span> <span m='981000'>you need
  to know how to parameterize motions,</span> <span m='985000'>and that involves a
  little bit of trigonometrics.</span> <span m='990000'>When we have seen these problems
  about rotating wheels,</span> <span m='993000'>say the cycloid, for example,</span>
  <span m='994000'>and so on there is a bit of cosine and sine and so on.</span> <span
  m='998000'>I think not much more on that. You won't need obscure</span> <span m='1001000'>trigonometric
  identities. You're next.</span> <span m='1008000'>Any proofs on the exam or just
  like problems?</span> <span m='1011000'>Well, a problem can ask you to show things.</span>
  <span m='1015000'>It is not going to be a complicated proof.</span> <span m='1018000'>The
  proofs are going to be fairly easy.</span> <span m='1020000'>If you look at practice
  1A, the last problem does have a</span> <span m='1024000'>little bit of proof. 6B
  says that show that blah,</span> <span m='1028000'>blah, blah. But, as you will
  see,</span> <span m='1031000'>it is not a difficult kind of proof.</span> <span
  m='1033000'>So, about the same. Yes?</span> <span m='1044000'>Are there equations
  of 3D shapes that we should know at</span> <span m='1049000'>this point? We should
  know definitely a lot</span> <span m='1052000'>about the equations of planes on
  lines.</span> <span m='1054000'>And you should probably know that a sphere centered
  at the</span> <span m='1057000'>origin is the set of points where distance to the
  center is</span> <span m='1060000'>equal to the radius of the sphere.</span> <span
  m='1063000'>We don't need more at this point.</span> <span m='1065000'>As the semester
  goes on, we will start seeing cones and</span> <span m='1068000'>things like that.
  But at this point planes, lines.</span> <span m='1072000'>And maybe you need to
  know about circles and spheres,</span> <span m='1078000'>but nothing beyond that.
  More questions?</span> <span m='1083000'>Yes? If there is a formula that you</span>
  <span m='1091000'>have proved on the homework then, yes, you can assume it on</span>
  <span m='1094000'>the test. Maybe you want to write on your</span> <span m='1097000'>test
  that this is a formula you have seen in homework just so</span> <span m='1100000'>that
  we know that you remember it from homework and not from</span> <span m='1104000'>looking
  over your neighbor's shoulder or whatever.</span> <span m='1107000'>Yes, it is OK
  to use things that you know general-speaking.</span> <span m='1111000'>That being
  said, for example,</span> <span m='1113000'>probably there will be a linear system
  to solve.</span> <span m='1117000'>It will say on the exam you are supposed to solve
  that using</span> <span m='1120000'>matrices, not by elimination. There are things
  like that.</span> <span m='1123000'>If a problem says solve by using vector methods,</span>
  <span m='1127000'>things like that, then try to use at least a</span> <span m='1131000'>vector
  somewhere. But, in general,</span> <span m='1134000'>you are allowed to use things
  that you know.</span> <span m='1138000'>Yes? Will we need to go from</span> <span
  m='1147000'>parametric equations to xy equations?</span> <span m='1149000'>Well,
  let's say only if it is very easy.</span> <span m='1156000'>If I give you a parametric
  curve, sin t,</span> <span m='1159000'>sin t, then you should be able to observe
  that it is on the</span> <span m='1165000'>line y equals x, not beyond that.</span>
  <span m='1169000'>Yes? Do we have to use -- Yes.</span> <span m='1177000'>I don't
  know if you will have to use it, but certainly you</span> <span m='1180000'>should
  know a little bit about the unit tangent vector.</span> <span m='1183000'>Just remember
  the main thing to know that the unit tangent</span> <span m='1191000'>vector is
  velocity divided by the speed.</span> <span m='1197000'>I mean there is not much
  more to it when you think about it.</span> <span m='1204000'>Yes? Kepler's law,</span>
  <span m='1211000'>well, you are allowed to use it if it helps you,</span> <span
  m='1213000'>if you find a way to squeeze it in.</span> <span m='1216000'>You don't
  have to know Kepler's law in detail.</span> <span m='1220000'>You just have to know
  how to reproduce the general steps.</span> <span m='1222000'>If I tell you R cross
  v is constant, you might be expected</span> <span m='1228000'>to know what to do
  with that. I would say -- Basically,</span> <span m='1233000'>you don't need to
  know Kepler's law.</span> <span m='1236000'>You need to know the kind of stuff that
  we saw when we</span> <span m='1238000'>derived it such as how to take the derivative
  of a dot-product</span> <span m='1241000'>or a cross-product. That is basically
  the answer.</span> <span m='1252000'>I don't see any questions anymore.</span> <span
  m='1255000'>Oh, you are raising your hand. Yes.</span> <span m='1263000'>How to
  calculate the distance between two lines and the</span> <span m='1266000'>distance
  between two planes? Well, you have seen,</span> <span m='1268000'>probably recently,
  that it is quite painful to do</span> <span m='1270000'>in general. And, no, I don't
  think that</span> <span m='1273000'>will be on the exam by itself. You need to know
  how to compute</span> <span m='1276000'>the distance between two points. That certainly
  you need to know.</span> <span m='1279000'>And also maybe how to find the compliment
  of a vector in a</span> <span m='1284000'>certain direction. And that is about it,</span>
  <span m='1288000'>I would say. I mean the more you know about</span> <span m='1293000'>things
  the better. Things that come up on part Bs</span> <span m='1298000'>of the problem
  sets are interesting things,</span> <span m='1303000'>but they are usually not needed
  on the exams.</span> <span m='1308000'>If you have more questions then you are not
  raising your hand</span> <span m='1313000'>high enough for me to see it. OK.</span>
  <span m='1315000'>Let's try to do a bit of this practice exam 1A.</span> <span m='1320000'>Hopefully,
  everybody has it. If you don't have it,</span> <span m='1323000'>hopefully your
  neighbor has it. If you don't have it and your</span> <span m='1327000'>neighbor
  doesn't have it then please raise your hand.</span> <span m='1329000'>I have a couple.</span>
  <span m='1377000'>If you neighbor has it then just follow with them for now.</span>
  <span m='1382000'>I think there are a few people behind you over there.</span> <span
  m='1385000'>I will stop handing them out now.</span> <span m='1386000'>If you really
  need one, it is on the website,</span> <span m='1391000'>it will be here at the
  end of class.</span> <span m='1395000'>Let's see. Well, I think we are going to</span>
  <span m='1403000'>just skip problems 1 and 2 because they are pretty</span> <span
  m='1407000'>straightforward and I hope that you know how to do them.</span> <span
  m='1412000'>I mean I don't know. Let's see.</span> <span m='1417000'>How many of
  you have no problem with problem 1?</span> <span m='1422000'>How many of you have
  trouble with problem 1?</span> <span m='1426000'>OK. How many of you haven't raised</span>
  <span m='1430000'>your hands? OK.</span> <span m='1432000'>How many of you have
  trouble with problem 2?</span> <span m='1436000'>OK. Well, if you have questions</span>
  <span m='1438000'>about those, maybe you should just come see me at the end</span>
  <span m='1441000'>because that is probably more efficient that way.</span> <span
  m='1444000'>I am going to start right away with problem 3,</span> <span m='1451000'>actually.
  Problem 3 says we have a matrix</span> <span m='1458000'>given to us |1 3 2; 2 0
  - 1; 1 1 0|.</span> <span m='1465000'>And it tells us determinant of A is 2 and
  inverse equals</span> <span m='1470000'>something, but we are missing two values
  A and B and we are</span> <span m='1474000'>supposed to find them. That means we
  need to do the</span> <span m='1481000'>steps of the algorithm to find the inverse
  of A.</span> <span m='1491000'>We are told that A inverse is one-half of |1 ...</span>
  <span m='1500000'>...; - 1 - 2 5; 2 2 - 6|.</span> <span m='1506000'>And here there
  are two unknown values.</span> <span m='1510000'>Remember, to invert a matrix, first
  we compute the minors.</span> <span m='1515000'>Then we flip some signs to get the
  cofactors.</span> <span m='1517000'>Then we transpose. And, finally,</span> <span
  m='1519000'>we divide by the determinant. Let's try to be smart about</span> <span
  m='1523000'>this. Do we need to compute all nine</span> <span m='1526000'>minors?
  No.</span> <span m='1527000'>We only need to compute two of them, right?</span>
  <span m='1530000'>Which minors do we need to compute?</span> <span m='1534000'>Here
  and here or here and here? Yeah, that looks better.</span> <span m='1539000'>Because,
  remember, we need to transpose things so</span> <span m='1543000'>these two guys
  will end up here. I claim we should compute these</span> <span m='1548000'>two minors.
  And we will see if that is good</span> <span m='1551000'>enough. If you start doing
  others and</span> <span m='1552000'>you find that they don't end up in the right
  place then just do</span> <span m='1556000'>more, but you don't need to spend</span>
  <span m='1558000'>your time computing all nine of them.</span> <span m='1560000'>If
  you are worried about not doing it right then,</span> <span m='1563000'>of course,
  you can maybe compute one or two more to just</span> <span m='1566000'>double-check
  your answers. But let us just do those that</span> <span m='1571000'>we think are
  needed. The matrix of minors.</span> <span m='1576000'>The one that goes in the
  middle position is obtained by deleting</span> <span m='1582000'>this row and that
  column, and we are left with a</span> <span m='1586000'>determinant |3 2;1 0|, 3
  times 0 minus 1 times 2</span> <span m='1592000'>should be - 2 should be - 2. Then
  the one in the lower left</span> <span m='1600000'>corner, we delete the last row
  and the first column,</span> <span m='1605000'>we are left with |3 2; 0 - 1|.</span>
  <span m='1607000'>3 times (- 1) is negative 3 minus 0.</span> <span m='1610000'>We
  are still left with negative three.</span> <span m='1618000'>Is that step clear
  for everyone? Then we need to go to cofactors.</span> <span m='1628000'>That means
  we need to change signs.</span> <span m='1630000'>The rule is -- We change signs
  in basically these four places.</span> <span m='1644000'>That means we will be left
  with positive 2 and negative 3.</span> <span m='1652000'>Then we take the transpose.
  That means the first column</span> <span m='1664000'>will copy into the first row,
  so this guy we still don't</span> <span m='1669000'>know, but here we will have
  two and</span> <span m='1672000'>here we will have minus three. Finally, we have
  to divide by</span> <span m='1679000'>the determinant of A. And here we are actually
  told</span> <span m='1685000'>that the determinant of A is two.</span> <span m='1688000'>So
  we will divide by two. But there is only one-half here</span> <span m='1692000'>so
  actually it is done for us. The values that we will put up</span> <span m='1698000'>there
  are going to be 2 and negative 3.</span> <span m='1710000'>Now let's see how we
  use that to solve a linear system.</span> <span m='1718000'>If we have to solve
  a linear system, Ax equals B,</span> <span m='1726000'>well, if the matrix is invertible,
  its determinant is</span> <span m='1730000'>not zero, so we can certainly write
  x</span> <span m='1734000'>equals A inverse B. So we have to multiply,</span> <span
  m='1741000'>that is one-half | 1 2 - 3; - 1 - 2 5; 2 2 - 6|.</span> <span m='1749000'>Times
  B [ 1, - 2,1].</span> <span m='1754000'>Remember, to do a matrix multiplication
  you take the rows</span> <span m='1757000'>in here, the columns in here and you
  do dot-products.</span> <span m='1761000'>The first entry will be one times one
  plus two times minus</span> <span m='1765000'>two plus minus three times one, one
  minus four minus three</span> <span m='1770000'>should be negative six, except I
  still have,</span> <span m='1775000'>of course, a one-half in front. Then minus
  one plus four plus</span> <span m='1783000'>five should be 8. Two minus four minus
  six should</span> <span m='1790000'>be -8. That will simplify to [- 3,4,</span>
  <span m='1797000'>- 5]. Any questions about that?</span> <span m='1804000'>OK. Now
  we come to part C which is</span> <span m='1808000'>the harder part of this problem.
  It says let's take this matrix</span> <span m='1813000'>A and let's replace the
  two in the upper right corner by some</span> <span m='1817000'>other number C. That
  means we will look at 1 3</span> <span m='1825000'>C; 2 0 - 1; 1 1 0|. And let's
  call that M.</span> <span m='1834000'>And it first asks you to find the value of
  C for which this</span> <span m='1840000'>matrix is not invertible. M is not invertible
  exactly</span> <span m='1848000'>when the determinant of M is zero.</span> <span
  m='1853000'>Let's compute the determinant. Well, we should do one times</span> <span
  m='1865000'>that smaller determinant, which is zero minus negative</span> <span
  m='1872000'>one, which is 1 times 1 minus three</span> <span m='1876000'>times that
  determinant, which is zero plus one is 1.</span> <span m='1883000'>And then we have
  plus C times the lower left determinant which</span> <span m='1888000'>is two times
  one minus zero is 2.</span> <span m='1891000'>That gives us one minus three is -
  2 2C.</span> <span m='1899000'>That is zero when C equals 1. For C equals 1,</span>
  <span m='1907000'>this matrix is not invertible. For other values it is</span> <span
  m='1913000'>invertible. It goes on to say let's look at</span> <span m='1918000'>this
  value of C and let's look at the system Mx equals zero.</span> <span m='1924000'>I
  am going to put value one in there.</span> <span m='1934000'>Now, if we look at
  Mx equals zero, well, this has either no</span> <span m='1940000'>solution or infinitely
  many solutions.</span> <span m='1944000'>But here there is an obvious solution.</span>
  <span m='1946000'>Namely x equals zero is a solution.</span> <span m='1950000'>Maybe
  let me rewrite it more geometrically.</span> <span m='1955000'>X 3 y z = 0. 2x -
  z = 0.</span> <span m='1964000'>And x y = 0. You see we have an obvious</span> <span
  m='1972000'>solution, (0,0, 0).</span> <span m='1974000'>But we have more solutions.
  How do we find more solutions?</span> <span m='1977000'>Well, (x, y, z) is a solution
  if it is in</span> <span m='1981000'>all three of these planes. That is a way to
  think about it.</span> <span m='1986000'>Probably we are actually in this situation
  where,</span> <span m='1993000'>in fact, we have three planes that are all passing
  through the</span> <span m='2000000'>origin and all parallel to the same line.</span>
  <span m='2005000'>And so that would be the line of solutions.</span> <span m='2008000'>To
  find it actually we can think of this as follows.</span> <span m='2012000'>The first
  observation is that actually in this situation we</span> <span m='2017000'>don't
  need all three equations. The fact that the system has</span> <span m='2021000'>infinitely
  many solutions means that actually one of the</span> <span m='2025000'>equations
  is redundant. If you look at it long enough</span> <span m='2029000'>you will see,
  for example,</span> <span m='2031000'>if you multiply three times this equation
  and you subtract</span> <span m='2035000'>that one then you will get the first equation.</span>
  <span m='2038000'>Three times (x y) - (2x - z) will be x 3y z.</span> <span m='2045000'>Now,
  we don't actually need to see that to solve a problem.</span> <span m='2048000'>I
  am just showing you that is what happens when you have a</span> <span m='2050000'>matrix
  with determinant zero. One of the equations is somehow</span> <span m='2054000'>a
  duplicate of the others. We don't actually need to</span> <span m='2059000'>figure
  out how exactly. What that means is really we</span> <span m='2064000'>want to solve,
  let's say start with two of the</span> <span m='2068000'>equations. To find the
  solution we can</span> <span m='2073000'>observe that the first equation says actually
  that <x,</span> <span m='2081000'>y, z> dot-product with</span> <span m='2086000'>=0.
  And the second equation says</span> <span m='2092000'>dot-product with <2,0,- 1>
  is zero.</span> <span m='2097000'>And the third equation, if we really want to keep
  it,</span> <span m='2103000'>says we should be also having this.</span> <span m='2108000'>Now,
  these equations now written like this,</span> <span m='2111000'>they are just saying
  we want an x, y, z that is perpendicular to</span> <span m='2115000'>these vectors.
  Let's forget this one and let's</span> <span m='2119000'>just look at these two.
  They are saying we want a</span> <span m='2123000'>vector that is perpendicular
  to these two given vectors.</span> <span m='2127000'>How do we find that? We do
  the cross-product.</span> <span m='2135000'>To find x, y, z perpendicular to <1,3,</span>
  <span m='2143000'>1> and <2,0, - 1>, we take the</span> <span m='2151000'>cross-product.
  And that will give us</span> <span m='2156000'>something. Well, let me just give
  you the</span> <span m='2158000'>answer. I am sure you know how to do</span> <span
  m='2160000'>cross-products by now. I don't have the answer here,</span> <span m='2167000'>so
  I guess I have to do it. That should be <- 3,</span> <span m='2178000'>probably
  positive 3, and then - 6>.</span> <span m='2186000'>That is the solution. And any
  multiple of that is a</span> <span m='2189000'>solution. If you like to neatly simplify</span>
  <span m='2191000'>them you could say negative one, one, negative two.</span> <span
  m='2194000'>If you like larger numbers you can multiply that by a million.</span>
  <span m='2197000'>That is also a solution. Any questions about that?</span> <span
  m='2210000'>Yes? That is correct.</span> <span m='2216000'>If you pick these two
  guys instead, you will get the same</span> <span m='2220000'>solution. Well, up
  to a multiple.</span> <span m='2222000'>It could be if you do the cross-product
  of these two guys</span> <span m='2226000'>you actually get something that is a
  multiple -- Actually,</span> <span m='2230000'>I think if you do the cross-product
  of the first and</span> <span m='2234000'>third one you will get actually minus
  one, one,</span> <span m='2237000'>minus two, the smaller one. But it doesn't matter.</span>
  <span m='2240000'>I mean it is really in the same direction.</span> <span m='2242000'>This
  is all because a plane has actually normal vectors of all</span> <span m='2247000'>sizes.
  Yes?</span> <span m='2252000'>I don't think so because -- An important thing to
  remember</span> <span m='2255000'>about cross-product is we compute for minors,</span>
  <span m='2258000'>but then we put a minus sign on the second component.</span> <span
  m='2260000'>The coefficient of j in here, the second component,</span> <span m='2264000'>you
  do one times minus two times one.</span> <span m='2267000'>That is negative three
  indeed. But then you actually change</span> <span m='2271000'>that to a positive
  three. Yes?</span> <span m='2294000'>Well, we don't have parametric equations here.</span>
  <span m='2301000'>Oh, solving by elimination. Well, if it says that you have</span>
  <span m='2305000'>to use vector methods then you should use vector methods.</span>
  <span m='2309000'>If it says you should use vectors and matrices then you</span>
  <span m='2312000'>are expected to do it that way. Yes?</span> <span m='2321000'>It
  depends what the problem is asking.</span> <span m='2323000'>The question is, is
  it enough to find the</span> <span m='2325000'>components of a vector or do we have
  to find the equation of a</span> <span m='2327000'>line? Here it says find one solution</span>
  <span m='2330000'>using vector operations. We have found one solution.</span> <span
  m='2335000'>If you wanted to find the line then it would all the things</span> <span
  m='2338000'>that are proportional to this. It would be maybe minus 3t,</span> <span
  m='2344000'>3t minus 6t, all the multiples of that</span> <span m='2349000'>vector.
  We do because (0,0,</span> <span m='2352000'>0) is an obvious solution. Maybe I
  should write that on</span> <span m='2357000'>the board. You had another question?</span>
  <span m='2368000'>Not quite. Let me re-explain first how we</span> <span m='2371000'>get
  all the solutions and why I did that cross-product.</span> <span m='2408000'>First
  of all, why did I take that</span> <span m='2409000'>cross-product again? I took
  that cross-product</span> <span m='2412000'>because I looked at my three equations
  and I observed that my</span> <span m='2417000'>three equations can be reformulated
  in terms of these</span> <span m='2421000'>dot-products saying that x, y, z is actually
  perpendicular</span> <span m='2425000'>these guys and these guys have normal vectors
  to the planes.</span> <span m='2429000'>Remember, to be in all three planes it has
  to be</span> <span m='2433000'>perpendicular to the normal vectors.</span> <span
  m='2436000'>That is how we got here. And now, if we want something</span> <span
  m='2440000'>that is perpendicular to a bunch of given vectors,</span> <span m='2443000'>well,
  to be perpendicular to two vectors,</span> <span m='2445000'>an easy way to find
  one is to take that cross-product.</span> <span m='2448000'>And, if you take any
  two of them, you will get something</span> <span m='2451000'>that is the same up
  to scaling. Now, what it means</span> <span m='2454000'>geometrically is that when
  we have our three planes and they</span> <span m='2460000'>all actually contain
  the same line -- And we know that is</span> <span m='2466000'>actually the smae
  case because they all pass through the</span> <span m='2471000'>origin. They pass
  through the origin</span> <span m='2476000'>because the constant terms are just
  zero.</span> <span m='2480000'>What happens is that the normal vectors to these
  planes are,</span> <span m='2486000'>in fact, all perpendicular to that line.</span>
  <span m='2489000'>The normal vectors -- Say this line is vertical.</span> <span
  m='2500000'>The normal vectors are all going to be horizontal.</span> <span m='2505000'>Well,
  it is kind of hard to draw.</span> <span m='2509000'>By taking the cross-product
  between two normal vectors we</span> <span m='2513000'>found this direction. Now,
  to find actually all the</span> <span m='2521000'>solutions. What we know so far
  is that we</span> <span m='2526000'>have this direction <-3 3 - 6>.</span> <span
  m='2531000'>That is going to be parallel to the line of intersections.</span> <span
  m='2534000'>Let me do it here, for example,</span> <span m='2539000'>. Now we have
  one particular</span> <span m='2549000'>solution. 0,0, 0.</span> <span m='2554000'>Actually,
  we have found another one, too, which is <- 3,3,</span> <span m='2559000'>- 6>.
  Anyway, if a line of solutions</span> <span m='2566000'>-- -- has parametric equation
  x = - 3t, y = 3t,</span> <span m='2575000'>z = - 6t, anything proportional to that.</span>
  <span m='2584000'>That is how we would find all the solutions if we wanted them.</span>
  <span m='2598000'>It is almost time. I think I need to jump ahead to</span> <span
  m='2602000'>other problems. Let's see.</span> <span m='2604000'>I think problem
  4 you can probably find for yourselves.</span> <span m='2609000'>It is a reasonably
  straightforward parametric</span> <span m='2612000'>equation problem. You just have
  to find the</span> <span m='2615000'>coordinates of point P. And for that it is
  a very</span> <span m='2619000'>simple trick. Problem 5.</span> <span m='2621000'>Find
  the area of a spaced triangle.</span> <span m='2623000'>It sounds like a cross-product.
  Find the equation of a plane</span> <span m='2627000'>also sounds like a cross-product.</span>
  <span m='2630000'>And find the intersection of this plane with a line means we</span>
  <span m='2633000'>find first the parametric equation of the line and then we</span>
  <span m='2636000'>plug that into the equation of the plane to get where they</span>
  <span m='2639000'>intersect. Does that sound reasonable?</span> <span m='2642000'>Who
  is disparate about problem 5?</span> <span m='2646000'>OK. Let me repeat problem
  5. First part we need to find the</span> <span m='2655000'>area of a triangle. And
  the way to do that is to</span> <span m='2659000'>just do one-half the length of
  a cross-product.</span> <span m='2662000'>If we have three points, P0, P1, P2 then
  maybe we can</span> <span m='2672000'>form vectors P0P1 and P0P2. And, if we take
  that</span> <span m='2678000'>cross-product and take the length of that and divide
  by</span> <span m='2682000'>two, that will give us the area of a triangle.</span>
  <span m='2686000'>Here it turns out that this guy is ,</span> <span m='2692000'>if
  I look at the solutions, so you will end up with square</span> <span m='2699000'>root
  of 6 over 2. The second is asking you for</span> <span m='2706000'>the equation
  of a plane containing these three points.</span> <span m='2713000'>Well, first of
  all, we know that a normal vector to</span> <span m='2723000'>the plane is going
  to be given by this cross-product again.</span> <span m='2734000'>That means that
  the equation of plane will be of a form x plus y</span> <span m='2740000'>plus 2z
  equals something. If a coefficient is here it</span> <span m='2745000'>comes from
  the normal vector. And to find what goes in the</span> <span m='2749000'>right-hand
  side, we just plug in any of the</span> <span m='2751000'>points. If you plug in
  P0,</span> <span m='2755000'>which is (2,1, 0) then two plus one seems like</span>
  <span m='2763000'>it is 3. And, if you want to</span> <span m='2766000'>double-check
  your answer, you can take P1 and P2 and</span> <span m='2768000'>check that you
  also get three. It is a good way to check your</span> <span m='2775000'>answer.
  Then the third part.</span> <span m='2778000'>We have a line parallel to the vector
  v equals one,</span> <span m='2785000'>one, one through the point S, which is (-
  1,0,</span> <span m='2791000'>0). That means you can find its</span> <span m='2794000'>parametric
  equation. X will start at - 1,</span> <span m='2797000'>increases at rate 1. Y starts
  at zero,</span> <span m='2801000'>increases at rate one. Z starts at zero,</span>
  <span m='2804000'>increases at rate one. You plug these into the plane</span> <span
  m='2808000'>equation, and that will tell you where they intersect.</span> <span
  m='2812000'>Is that clear? And now, in the last one</span> <span m='2818000'>minute,
  on that side I have one minute,</span> <span m='2823000'>let me just say very quickly
  -- Well,</span> <span m='2828000'>do you want to hear about problem 6 anyway very
  quickly?</span> <span m='2830000'>Yeah. OK. Problem 6 is one of these like</span>
  <span m='2840000'>vector calculations. It says we have a position</span> <span m='2844000'>vector
  R. And it asks you how do we find</span> <span m='2848000'>the derivative of R dot
  R? Well, remember we have a</span> <span m='2852000'>product rule for taking the
  derivative.</span> <span m='2854000'>UV prime is U prime V plus UV prime.</span>
  <span m='2857000'>It also applies for dot-product. That is dR by dt dot R plus R</span>
  <span m='2864000'>dot dR by dt. And these are both the same</span> <span m='2869000'>thing.
  You get two R dot dR/dt,</span> <span m='2872000'>but dR/dt is v for velocity vector.</span>
  <span m='2877000'>Hopefully you have seen things like that.</span> <span m='2880000'>Now,
  it says show that if R has constant length then they are</span> <span m='2884000'>perpendicular.
  All you need to write basically</span> <span m='2890000'>is we assume length R is
  constant.</span> <span m='2895000'>That is what it says, R has constant length.</span>
  <span m='2898000'>Well, how do we get to, say, something we probably want</span>
  <span m='2901000'>to reduce to that? Well, if R is constant in</span> <span m='2906000'>length
  then R dot R is also constant.</span> <span m='2912000'>And so that means d by dt
  of R dot R is zero.</span> <span m='2919000'>That is what it means to be constant.</span>
  <span m='2921000'>And so that means R dot v is zero.</span> <span m='2926000'>That
  means R is perpendicular to v.</span> <span m='2932000'>That is a proof. It is not
  a scary proof.</span> <span m='2938000'>And then the last question of the exam says
  let's continue to</span> <span m='2944000'>assume that R has constant length, and
  let's try to find R</span> <span m='2950000'>dot v. If there is acceleration then</span>
  <span m='2953000'>probably we should bring it in somewhere, maybe by taking a</span>
  <span m='2957000'>derivative of something. If we know that R dot v equals</span>
  <span m='2961000'>zero, let's take the derivative of that.</span> <span m='2964000'>That
  is still zero. But now, using the product</span> <span m='2972000'>rule, dR/dt is
  v dot v plus R dot dv/dt is going to be zero.</span> <span m='2980000'>That means
  that you are asked about R dot A.</span> <span m='2983000'>Well, that is equal to
  minus V dot V.</span> <span m='2988000'>And that is it.</span> </p>
