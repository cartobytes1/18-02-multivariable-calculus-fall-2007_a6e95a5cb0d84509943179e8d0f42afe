  <span m='23000'>Let me start by basically listing the main things we have</span>
  <span m='25000'>learned over the past three weeks or so.</span> <span m='28000'>And
  I will add a few complements of information about</span> <span m='31000'>that because
  there are a few small details that I didn't</span> <span m='34000'>quite clarify
  and that I should probably make a bit clearer,</span> <span m='38000'>especially
  what happened at the very end of yesterday's class.</span> <span m='48000'>Here
  is a list of things that should be on your review sheet</span> <span m='56000'>for
  the exam. The first thing we learned</span> <span m='61000'>about, the main topic
  of this unit is about functions of</span> <span m='68000'>several variables. We
  have learned how to think of</span> <span m='72000'>functions of two or three variables
  in terms of plotting</span> <span m='76000'>them. In particular,</span> <span m='77000'>well,
  not only the graph but also the contour plot and how to</span> <span m='79000'>read
  a contour plot. And we have learned how to</span> <span m='87000'>study variations
  of these functions using partial</span> <span m='98000'>derivatives. Remember, we
  have defined the</span> <span m='104000'>partial of f with respect to some variable,</span>
  <span m='107000'>say, x to be the rate of change with respect to x when we hold</span>
  <span m='112000'>all the other variables constant.</span> <span m='115000'>If you
  have a function of x and y, this symbol means you</span> <span m='121000'>differentiate
  with respect to x treating y as a constant.</span> <span m='127000'>And we have
  learned how to package partial derivatives into</span> <span m='135000'>a vector,the
  gradient vector. For example,</span> <span m='140000'>if we have a function of three
  variables, the vector whose</span> <span m='144000'>components are the partial derivatives.</span>
  <span m='146000'>And we have seen how to use the gradient vector or the partial</span>
  <span m='153000'>derivatives to derive various things such as approximation</span>
  <span m='159000'>formulas. The change in f,</span> <span m='163000'>when we change
  x, y, z slightly,</span> <span m='168000'>is approximately equal to, well, there
  are several terms.</span> <span m='177000'>And I can rewrite this in vector form
  as the gradient dot</span> <span m='183000'>product the amount by which the position
  vector has changed.</span> <span m='188000'>Basically, what causes f to change is
  that I am changing x,</span> <span m='191000'>y and z by small amounts and how sensitive
  f is to each</span> <span m='196000'>variable is precisely what the partial derivatives
  measure.</span> <span m='202000'>And, in particular, this approximation is called</span>
  <span m='206000'>the tangent plane approximation because it tells us,</span> <span
  m='210000'>in fact, it amounts to identifying the</span> <span m='215000'>graph
  of the function with its tangent plane.</span> <span m='218000'>It means that we
  assume that the function depends more or</span> <span m='223000'>less linearly on
  x, y and z.</span> <span m='225000'>And, if we set these things equal, what we get
  is actually,</span> <span m='228000'>we are replacing the function by its linear
  approximation.</span> <span m='232000'>We are replacing the graph by its tangent
  plane.</span> <span m='236000'>Except, of course, we haven't see the graph of a</span>
  <span m='238000'>function of three variables because that would live in</span> <span
  m='240000'>4-dimensional space. So, when we think of a graph,</span> <span m='244000'>really,
  it is a function of two variables.</span> <span m='248000'>That also tells us how
  to find tangent planes to level</span> <span m='252000'>surfaces.</span> <span m='262000'>Recall
  that the tangent plane to a surface,</span> <span m='270000'>given by the equation
  f of x, y, z equals z,</span> <span m='277000'>at a given point can be found by
  looking first for its normal</span> <span m='283000'>vector. And we know that the
  normal</span> <span m='287000'>vector is actually, well,</span> <span m='289000'>one
  normal vector is given by the gradient of a function</span> <span m='293000'>because
  we know that the gradient is actually pointing</span> <span m='296000'>perpendicularly
  to the level sets towards higher values of a</span> <span m='301000'>function. And
  it gives us the direction</span> <span m='305000'>of fastest increase of a function.</span>
  <span m='308000'>OK. Any questions about these</span> <span m='313000'>topics? No.</span>
  <span m='318000'>OK. Let me add, actually,</span> <span m='320000'>a cultural note
  to what we have seen so far about partial</span> <span m='323000'>derivatives and
  how to use them, which is maybe something I</span> <span m='328000'>should have
  mentioned a couple of weeks ago.</span> <span m='332000'>Why do we like partial
  derivatives?</span> <span m='333000'>Well, one obvious reason is we can do all these
  things.</span> <span m='337000'>But another reason is that, really,</span> <span
  m='339000'>you need partial derivatives to do physics and to understand</span> <span
  m='342000'>much of the world that is around you because a lot of things</span> <span
  m='346000'>actually are governed by what is called partial differentiation</span>
  <span m='350000'>equations.</span> <span m='359000'>So if you want a cultural remark
  about what this is good</span> <span m='367000'>for. A partial differential equation</span>
  <span m='369000'>is an equation that involves the partial derivatives of a</span>
  <span m='373000'>function. So you have some function that</span> <span m='375000'>is
  unknown that depends on a bunch of variables.</span> <span m='378000'>And a partial
  differential equation is some relation</span> <span m='383000'>between its partial
  derivatives. Let me see.</span> <span m='388000'>These are equations involving the
  partial derivatives -- -- of</span> <span m='405000'>an unknown function. Let me
  give you an example to</span> <span m='414000'>see how that works. For example,</span>
  <span m='417000'>the heat equation is one example of a partial</span> <span m='422000'>differential
  equation. It is the equation -- Well,</span> <span m='429000'>let me write for you
  the space version of it.</span> <span m='435000'>It is the equation partial f over
  partial t equals some</span> <span m='441000'>constant times the sum of the second
  partials with respect to</span> <span m='447000'>x, y and z. So this is an equation
  where we</span> <span m='452000'>are trying to solve for a function f that depends,</span>
  <span m='458000'>actually, on four variables, x, y, z, t.</span> <span m='462000'>And
  what should you have in mind?</span> <span m='467000'>Well, this equation governs
  temperature.</span> <span m='470000'>If you think that f of x, y, z, t will be the
  temperature at a</span> <span m='475000'>point in space at position x, y, z and
  at time t,</span> <span m='479000'>then this tells you how temperature changes over
  time.</span> <span m='484000'>It tells you that at any given point,</span> <span
  m='487000'>the rate of change of temperature over time is given</span> <span m='490000'>by
  this complicated expression in the partial derivatives in</span> <span m='495000'>terms
  of the space coordinates x, y, z.</span> <span m='498000'>If you know, for example,
  the initial distribution of</span> <span m='501000'>temperature in this room, and
  if you assume that nothing</span> <span m='504000'>is generating heat or taking
  heat away,</span> <span m='506000'>so if you don't have any air conditioning or
  heating going</span> <span m='509000'>on, then it will tell you how the</span> <span
  m='511000'>temperature will change over time and eventually stabilize to</span>
  <span m='515000'>some final value. Yes?</span> <span m='521000'>Why do we take the
  partial derivative twice?</span> <span m='523000'>Well, that is a question, I would
  say,</span> <span m='525000'>for a physics person. But in a few weeks we will</span>
  <span m='528000'>actually see a derivation of where this equation comes from</span>
  <span m='532000'>and try to justify it. But, really,</span> <span m='535000'>that
  is something you will see in a physics class.</span> <span m='537000'>The reason
  for that is basically physics of how heat is</span> <span m='542000'>transported
  between particles in fluid, or actually any medium.</span> <span m='549000'>This
  constant k actually is called the heat conductivity.</span> <span m='552000'>It
  tells you how well the heat flows through the material that</span> <span m='557000'>you
  are looking at. Anyway, I am giving it to you</span> <span m='560000'>just to show
  you an example of a real life problem where,</span> <span m='563000'>in fact, you
  have to solve one of these things.</span> <span m='566000'>Now, how to solve partial
  differential equations is not a</span> <span m='569000'>topic for this class. It
  is not even a topic for</span> <span m='572000'>18.03 which is called Differential
  Equations,</span> <span m='574000'>without partial, which means there actually you</span>
  <span m='578000'>will learn tools to study and solve these equations but when</span>
  <span m='581000'>there is only one variable involved.</span> <span m='583000'>And
  you will see it is already quite hard.</span> <span m='587000'>And, if you want
  more on that one, we have many fine classes</span> <span m='590000'>about partial
  differential equations.</span> <span m='592000'>But one thing at a time. I wanted
  to point out to you</span> <span m='598000'>that very often functions that you see
  in real life satisfy</span> <span m='603000'>many nice relations between the partial
  derivatives.</span> <span m='608000'>That was in case you were wondering why on
  the syllabus</span> <span m='610000'>for today it said partial differential equations.</span>
  <span m='613000'>Now we have officially covered the topic.</span> <span m='615000'>That
  is basically all we need to know about it.</span> <span m='620000'>But we will come
  back to that a bit later.</span> <span m='622000'>You will see. OK.</span> <span
  m='627000'>If there are no further questions, let me continue and</span> <span m='630000'>go
  back to my list of topics. Oh, sorry.</span> <span m='633000'>I should have written
  down that this equation is solved by</span> <span m='642000'>temperature for point
  x, y, z at time t.</span> <span m='648000'>OK. And there are, actually,</span> <span
  m='652000'>many other interesting partial differential equations you will</span>
  <span m='656000'>maybe sometimes learn about the wave equation that governs how</span>
  <span m='659000'>waves propagate in space, about the diffusion equation,</span>
  <span m='662000'>when you have maybe a mixture of two fluids,</span> <span m='667000'>how
  they somehow mix over time and so on.</span> <span m='671000'>Basically, to every
  problem you might want to consider there is</span> <span m='676000'>a partial differential
  equation to solve.</span> <span m='679000'>OK. Anyway. Sorry. Back to my list of
  topics.</span> <span m='683000'>One important application we have seen of partial
  derivatives</span> <span m='687000'>is to try to optimize things, try to solve minimum/maximum</span>
  <span m='690000'>problems.</span> <span m='702000'>Remember that we have introduced
  the notion of</span> <span m='707000'>critical points of a function. A critical
  point is when all</span> <span m='716000'>the partial derivatives are zero.</span>
  <span m='723000'>And then there are various kinds of critical points.</span> <span
  m='725000'>There is maxima and there is minimum, but there is also</span> <span
  m='729000'>saddle points. And we have seen a method using</span> <span m='735000'>second
  derivatives -- -- to decide which kind of critical</span> <span m='744000'>point
  we have. I should say that is for a</span> <span m='749000'>function of two variables
  to try to decide whether a given</span> <span m='755000'>critical point is a minimum,
  a maximum or a saddle point.</span> <span m='761000'>And we have also seen that
  actually that is not enough to</span> <span m='764000'>find the minimum of a maximum
  of a function because the minimum</span> <span m='768000'>of a maximum could occur
  on the boundary.</span> <span m='770000'>Just to give you a small reminder,</span>
  <span m='773000'>when you have a function of one variables,</span> <span m='775000'>if
  you are trying to find the minimum and the maximum of a</span> <span m='780000'>function
  whose graph looks like this,</span> <span m='783000'>well, you are going to tell
  me, quite obviously,</span> <span m='785000'>that the maximum is this point up here.</span>
  <span m='787000'>And that is a point where the first derivative is zero.</span>
  <span m='791000'>That is a critical point. And we used the second</span> <span m='794000'>derivative
  to see that this critical point is a local</span> <span m='798000'>maximum. But
  then, when we are looking</span> <span m='800000'>for the minimum of a function,
  well, it is not at a critical</span> <span m='803000'>point. It is actually here
  at the</span> <span m='806000'>boundary of the domain, you know, the range of values</span>
  <span m='810000'>that we are going to consider. Here the minimum is at the</span>
  <span m='818000'>boundary. And the maximum is at a</span> <span m='824000'>critical
  point. Similarly, when you have a</span> <span m='830000'>function of several variables,
  say of two variables,</span> <span m='833000'>for example, then the minimum and
  the</span> <span m='835000'>maximum will be achieved either at a critical point.</span>
  <span m='838000'>And then we can use these methods to find where they are.</span>
  <span m='841000'>Or, somewhere on the boundary of a set of values that are</span>
  <span m='846000'>allowed. It could be that we actually</span> <span m='849000'>achieve
  a minimum by making x and y as small as possible.</span> <span m='853000'>Maybe
  letting them go to zero if they had to be positive or</span> <span m='856000'>maybe
  by making them go to infinity.</span> <span m='859000'>So, we have to keep our minds
  open and look at various</span> <span m='863000'>possibilities. We are going to
  do a problem</span> <span m='866000'>like that. We are going to go over a</span>
  <span m='869000'>practice problem from the practice test to clarify this.</span>
  <span m='874000'>Another important cultural application of minimum/maximum</span>
  <span m='878000'>problems in two variables that we have seen in class is the</span>
  <span m='882000'>least squared method to find the best fit line,</span> <span m='885000'>or
  the best fit anything, really,</span> <span m='889000'>to find when you have a set
  of data points what is the best</span> <span m='896000'>linear approximately for
  these data points.</span> <span m='901000'>And here I have some good news for you.</span>
  <span m='903000'>While you should definitely know what this is about,</span> <span
  m='907000'>it will not be on the test.</span> <span m='930000'>[APPLAUSE] That doesn't
  mean that you</span> <span m='935000'>should forget everything we have seen about
  it,</span> <span m='941000'>OK? Now what is next on my list of</span> <span m='951000'>topics?
  We have seen differentials.</span> <span m='958000'>Remember the differential of
  f, by definition,</span> <span m='963000'>would be this kind of quantity. At first
  it looks just like a</span> <span m='969000'>new way to package partial derivatives
  together into some</span> <span m='972000'>new kind of object. Now, what is this
  good for?</span> <span m='975000'>Well, it is a good way to remember approximation
  formulas.</span> <span m='978000'>It is a good way to also study how variations
  in x,</span> <span m='982000'>y, z relate to variations in f. In particular,</span>
  <span m='986000'>we can divide this by variations,</span> <span m='990000'>actually,
  by dx or by dy or by dz in any situation that we</span> <span m='994000'>want, or
  by d of some other variable</span> <span m='1000000'>to get chain rules. The chain
  rule says,</span> <span m='1006000'>for example, there are many situations.</span>
  <span m='1010000'>But, for example, if x, y and z depend on some</span> <span m='1016000'>other
  variable, say of variables maybe even u</span> <span m='1024000'>and v, then that
  means that f becomes</span> <span m='1028000'>a function of u and v. And then we
  can ask ourselves,</span> <span m='1033000'>how sensitive is f to a value of u?</span>
  <span m='1038000'>Well, we can answer that. The chain rule is something</span> <span
  m='1045000'>like this. And let me explain to you again</span> <span m='1053000'>where
  this comes from. Basically, what this quantity</span> <span m='1061000'>means is
  if we change u and keep v constant, what happens to the</span> <span m='1066000'>value
  of f? Well, why would the value of f</span> <span m='1068000'>change in the first
  place when f is just a function of x,</span> <span m='1071000'>y, z and not directly
  of you? Well, it changes because x,</span> <span m='1075000'>y and z depend on u.
  First we have to figure out how</span> <span m='1079000'>quickly x, y and z change
  when we change u.</span> <span m='1082000'>Well, how quickly they do that is precisely
  partial x over</span> <span m='1085000'>partial u, partial y over partial u, partial
  z over</span> <span m='1088000'>partial u. These are the rates of change</span>
  <span m='1090000'>of x, y, z when we change u. And now, when we change x,</span>
  <span m='1094000'>y and z, that causes f to change.</span> <span m='1097000'>How
  much does f change? Well, partial f over partial x</span> <span m='1101000'>tells
  us how quickly f changes if I just change x.</span> <span m='1105000'>I get this.
  That is the change in f caused</span> <span m='1109000'>just by the fact that x
  changes when u changes.</span> <span m='1113000'>But then y also changes. y changes
  at this rate.</span> <span m='1116000'>And that causes f to change at that rate.</span>
  <span m='1119000'>And z changes as well, and that causes f to change at</span> <span
  m='1122000'>that rate. And the effects add up together.</span> <span m='1125000'>Does
  that make sense? OK.</span> <span m='1137000'>And so, in particular, we can use
  the chain rule to do</span> <span m='1140000'>changes of variables. If we have,
  say,</span> <span m='1143000'>a function in terms of polar coordinates on theta
  and we like</span> <span m='1148000'>to switch it to rectangular coordinates x and
  y then we can</span> <span m='1154000'>use chain rules to relate the partial derivatives.</span>
  <span m='1159000'>And finally, last but not least,</span> <span m='1163000'>we have
  seen how to deal with non-independent variables.</span> <span m='1171000'>When our
  variables say x, y, z related by some equation.</span> <span m='1177000'>One way
  we can deal with this is to solve for one of the</span> <span m='1181000'>variables
  and go back to two independent variables,</span> <span m='1184000'>but we cannot
  always do that. Of course, on the exam,</span> <span m='1187000'>you can be sure
  that I will make sure that you cannot solve</span> <span m='1190000'>for a variable
  you want to remove because that would be too</span> <span m='1193000'>easy. Then
  when we have to look at</span> <span m='1196000'>all of them, we will have to take
  into account this relation,</span> <span m='1202000'>we have seen two useful methods.</span>
  <span m='1205000'>One of them is to find the minimum of a maximum of a</span> <span
  m='1209000'>function when the variables are not independent,</span> <span m='1213000'>and
  that is the method of Lagrange multipliers.</span> <span m='1233000'>Remember, to
  find the minimum or the maximum of the function</span> <span m='1239000'>f, subject
  to the constraint g</span> <span m='1245000'>equals constant, well, we write down
  equations</span> <span m='1252000'>that say that the gradient of f is actually proportional
  to the</span> <span m='1259000'>gradient of g. There is a new variable here,</span>
  <span m='1264000'>lambda, the multiplier. And so, for example,</span> <span m='1268000'>well,
  I guess here I had functions of three variables,</span> <span m='1272000'>so this
  becomes three equations.</span> <span m='1274000'>f sub x equals lambda g sub x,
  f sub y equals lambda g sub y,</span> <span m='1281000'>and f sub z equals lambda
  g sub z.</span> <span m='1285000'>And, when we plug in the formulas for f and g,</span>
  <span m='1287000'>well, we are left with three equations involving the four</span>
  <span m='1291000'>variables, x, y, z and lambda.</span> <span m='1293000'>What is
  wrong? Well, we don't have actually</span> <span m='1296000'>four independent variables.
  We also have this relation,</span> <span m='1301000'>whatever the constraint was
  relating x, y and z together.</span> <span m='1308000'>Then we can try to solve
  this. And, depending on the</span> <span m='1311000'>situation, it is sometimes
  easy. And it sometimes it is very</span> <span m='1316000'>hard or even impossible.
  But on the test,</span> <span m='1321000'>I haven't decided yet, but it could well
  be that the</span> <span m='1323000'>problem about Lagrange multipliers just asks
  you to</span> <span m='1326000'>write the equations and not to solve them.</span>
  <span m='1328000'>[APPLAUSE] Well, I don't know yet.</span> <span m='1334000'>I
  am not promising anything. But, before you start solving,</span> <span m='1338000'>check
  whether the problem asks you to solve them or not.</span> <span m='1343000'>If it
  doesn't then probably you shouldn't.</span> <span m='1382000'>Another topic that
  we solved just yesterday is constrained</span> <span m='1389000'>partial derivatives.
  And I guess I have to</span> <span m='1393000'>re-explain a little bit because my
  guess is that things were not</span> <span m='1399000'>extremely clear at the end
  of class yesterday.</span> <span m='1403000'>Now we are in the same situation.</span>
  <span m='1405000'>We have a function, let's say, f of x,</span> <span m='1409000'>y,
  z where variables x, y and z are not independent but</span> <span m='1414000'>are
  constrained by some relation of this form.</span> <span m='1419000'>Some quantity
  involving x, y and z is equal to maybe zero</span> <span m='1423000'>or some other
  constant. And then, what we want to know,</span> <span m='1427000'>is what is the
  rate of change of f with respect to one of the</span> <span m='1431000'>variables,
  say, x, y or z when I keep the</span> <span m='1437000'>others constant? Well, I
  cannot keep all the</span> <span m='1442000'>other constant because that would not
  be compatible with</span> <span m='1447000'>this condition. I mean that would be
  the usual</span> <span m='1451000'>or so-called formal partial derivative of f ignoring
  the</span> <span m='1455000'>constraint. To take this into account means</span>
  <span m='1458000'>that if we vary one variable while keeping another one fixed</span>
  <span m='1463000'>then the third one, since it depends on them,</span> <span m='1466000'>must
  also change somehow. And we must take that into</span> <span m='1471000'>account.
  Let's say, for example,</span> <span m='1474000'>we want to find -- I am going to
  do a different example from</span> <span m='1479000'>yesterday. So, if you really
  didn't like</span> <span m='1482000'>that one, you don't have to see it again.</span>
  <span m='1486000'>Let's say that we want to find the partial derivative of f with</span>
  <span m='1491000'>respect to z keeping y constant. What does that mean?</span> <span
  m='1496000'>That means y is constant, z varies and x somehow is</span> <span m='1503000'>mysteriously
  a function of y and z for this equation.</span> <span m='1511000'>And then, of course
  because it depends on y,</span> <span m='1514000'>that means x will vary. Sorry,
  depends on y and z and z</span> <span m='1519000'>varies. Now we are asking ourselves</span>
  <span m='1521000'>what is the rate of change of f with respect to z in this</span>
  <span m='1525000'>situation?</span> <span m='1542000'>And so we have two methods
  to do that.</span> <span m='1547000'>Let me start with the one with differentials
  that hopefully you</span> <span m='1555000'>kind of understood yesterday, but if
  not here is a second</span> <span m='1562000'>chance. Using differentials means
  that</span> <span m='1566000'>we will try to express df in terms of dz in this particular</span>
  <span m='1570000'>situation. What do we know about df in</span> <span m='1574000'>general?
  Well, we know that df is f sub</span> <span m='1579000'>x dx plus f sub y dy plus
  f sub z dz.</span> <span m='1585000'>That is the general statement. But, of course,</span>
  <span m='1588000'>we are in a special case. We are in a special case where</span>
  <span m='1591000'>first y is constant. y is constant means that we can</span> <span
  m='1601000'>set dy to be zero. This goes away and becomes zero.</span> <span m='1610000'>The
  second thing is actually we don't care about x.</span> <span m='1613000'>We would
  like to get rid of x because it is this dependent</span> <span m='1617000'>variable.
  What we really want to do is</span> <span m='1620000'>express df only in terms of
  dz. What we need is to relate dx</span> <span m='1632000'>with dz. Well, to do that,</span>
  <span m='1636000'>we need to look at how the variables are related so we need</span>
  <span m='1640000'>to look at the constraint g. Well, how do we do that?</span> <span
  m='1644000'>We look at the differential g. So dg is g sub x dx plus g sub</span>
  <span m='1651000'>y dy plus g sub z dz. And that is zero because we are</span> <span
  m='1657000'>setting g to always stay constant.</span> <span m='1660000'>So, g doesn't
  change. If g doesn't change then we</span> <span m='1664000'>have a relation between
  dx, dy and dz.</span> <span m='1668000'>Well, in fact, we say we are going to look</span>
  <span m='1670000'>only at the case where y is constant.</span> <span m='1672000'>y
  doesn't change and this becomes zero.</span> <span m='1676000'>Well, now we have
  a relation between dx and dz.</span> <span m='1679000'>We know how x depends on
  z. And when we know how x depends</span> <span m='1685000'>on z, we can plug that
  into here and get how f depends on z.</span> <span m='1690000'>Let's do that.</span>
  <span m='1708000'>Again, saying that g cannot change and keeping y constant</span>
  <span m='1713000'>tells us g sub x dx plus g sub z dz is zero and we would like
  to</span> <span m='1719000'>solve for dx in terms of dz. That tells us dx should
  be</span> <span m='1726000'>minus g sub z dz divided by g sub x.</span> <span m='1733000'>If
  you want, this is the rate of change of x</span> <span m='1737000'>with respect
  to z when we keep y constant.</span> <span m='1740000'>In our new terminology this
  is partial x over partial z with y</span> <span m='1753000'>held constant. This
  is the rate of change of x</span> <span m='1758000'>with respect to z. Now, when
  we know that,</span> <span m='1763000'>we are going to plug that into this equation.</span>
  <span m='1770000'>And that will tell us that df is f sub x times dx.</span> <span
  m='1777000'>Well, what is dx? dx is now minus g sub z over g</span> <span m='1783000'>sub
  x dz plus f sub z dz. So that will be minus fx g sub</span> <span m='1791000'>z
  over g sub x plus f sub z times dz.</span> <span m='1796000'>And so this coefficient
  here is the rate of change of f with</span> <span m='1802000'>respect to z in the
  situation we are considering.</span> <span m='1806000'>This quantity is what we
  call partial f over partial z with y</span> <span m='1813000'>held constant. That
  is what we wanted to find.</span> <span m='1821000'>Now, let's see another way to
  do the same calculation and then</span> <span m='1825000'>you can choose which one
  you prefer.</span> <span m='1857000'>The other method is using the chain rule.</span>
  <span m='1869000'>We use the chain rule to understand how f depends on z</span>
  <span m='1874000'>when y is held constant. Let me first try the chain rule</span>
  <span m='1879000'>brutally and then we will try to analyze what is going on.</span>
  <span m='1884000'>You can just use the version that I have up there as a</span>
  <span m='1889000'>template to see what is going on, but I am going to explain it</span>
  <span m='1895000'>more carefully again.</span> <span m='1910000'>That is the most
  mechanical and mindless way of writing down the</span> <span m='1917000'>chain rule.
  I am just saying here that I am</span> <span m='1921000'>varying z, keeping y constant,
  and I want to know how f</span> <span m='1924000'>changes. Well, f might change
  because x</span> <span m='1927000'>might change, y might change and z might</span>
  <span m='1930000'>change. Now, how quickly does x change?</span> <span m='1934000'>Well,
  the rate of change of x in this situation is partial x,</span> <span m='1938000'>partial
  z with y held constant. If I change x at this rate then</span> <span m='1944000'>f
  will change at that rate. Now, y might change,</span> <span m='1949000'>so the rate
  of change of y would be the rate of change of y</span> <span m='1952000'>with respect
  to z holding y constant.</span> <span m='1955000'>Wait a second. If y is held constant
  then y</span> <span m='1958000'>doesn't change. So, actually,</span> <span m='1960000'>this
  guy is zero and you didn't really have to write that term.</span> <span m='1963000'>But
  I wrote it just to be systematic.</span> <span m='1967000'>If y had been somehow
  able to change at a certain rate then</span> <span m='1971000'>that would have caused
  f to change at that rate.</span> <span m='1974000'>And, of course, if y is held
  constant then</span> <span m='1977000'>nothing happens here. Finally, while z is
  changing at</span> <span m='1981000'>a certain rate, this rate is this one and that</span>
  <span m='1985000'>causes f to change at that rate. And then we add the effects</span>
  <span m='1990000'>together. See, it is nothing but the</span> <span m='1992000'>good-old
  chain rule. Just I have put these extra</span> <span m='1996000'>subscripts to tell
  us what is held constant and what isn't.</span> <span m='2002000'>Now, of course
  we can simplify it a little bit more.</span> <span m='2003000'>Because, here, how
  quickly does z change if I</span> <span m='2007000'>am changing z? Well, the rate
  of change of z,</span> <span m='2012000'>with respect to itself, is just one.</span>
  <span m='2017000'>In fact, the really mysterious part of this is the one here,</span>
  <span m='2021000'>which is the rate of change of x with respect to z.</span> <span
  m='2025000'>And, to find that, we have to understand the</span> <span m='2029000'>constraint.
  How can we find the rate of</span> <span m='2032000'>change of x with respect to
  z? Well, we could use</span> <span m='2034000'>differentials, like we did here,</span>
  <span m='2036000'>but we can also keep using the chain rule.</span> <span m='2057000'>How
  can I do that? Well, I can just look at how g</span> <span m='2060000'>would change
  with respect to z when y is held constant.</span> <span m='2064000'>I just do the
  same calculation with g instead of f.</span> <span m='2073000'>But, before I do
  it, let's ask ourselves first what</span> <span m='2077000'>is this equal to. Well,
  if g is held constant</span> <span m='2080000'>then, when we vary z keeping y constant
  and changing x,</span> <span m='2084000'>well, g still doesn't change. It is held
  constant.</span> <span m='2093000'>In fact, that should be zero. But, if we just
  say that,</span> <span m='2098000'>we are not going to get to that.</span> <span
  m='2101000'>Let's see how we can compute that using the chain rule.</span> <span
  m='2104000'>Well, the chain rule tells us g changes because x,</span> <span m='2109000'>y
  and z change. How does it change because of x?</span> <span m='2112000'>Well, partial
  g over partial x times the rate of change of x.</span> <span m='2118000'>How does
  it change because of y? Well, partial g over partial y</span> <span m='2121000'>times
  the rate of change of y. But, of course,</span> <span m='2124000'>if you are smarter
  than me then you don't need to actually write</span> <span m='2128000'>this one
  because y is held constant.</span> <span m='2131000'>And then there is the rate
  of change because z changes.</span> <span m='2138000'>And how quickly z changes
  here, of course, is one.</span> <span m='2145000'>Out of this you get, well, I am
  tired of writing</span> <span m='2150000'>partial g over partial x. We can just
  write g sub x times</span> <span m='2158000'>partial x over partial z y constant
  plus g sub z.</span> <span m='2165000'>And now we found how x depends on z.</span>
  <span m='2171000'>Partial x over partial z with y held constant is negative g sub</span>
  <span m='2177000'>z over g sub x. Now we plug that into that and</span> <span m='2184000'>we
  get our answer. It goes all the way up here.</span> <span m='2192000'>And then we
  get the answer. I am not going to,</span> <span m='2194000'>well, I guess I can
  write it again.</span> <span m='2207000'>There was partial f over partial x times
  this guy,</span> <span m='2212000'>minus g sub z over g sub x, plus partial f over
  partial z.</span> <span m='2219000'>And you can observe that this is exactly the
  same formula that</span> <span m='2223000'>we had over here. In fact, let's compare
  this to</span> <span m='2227000'>make it side by side. I claim we did exactly the
  same</span> <span m='2230000'>thing, just with different notations.</span> <span
  m='2233000'>If you take the differential of f and you divide it by dz in</span>
  <span m='2237000'>this situation where y is held constant and so on,</span> <span
  m='2240000'>you get exactly this chain rule up there.</span> <span m='2243000'>That
  chain rule up there is this guy, df,</span> <span m='2248000'>divided by dz with
  y held constant.</span> <span m='2253000'>And the term involving dy was replaced
  by zero on both sides</span> <span m='2258000'>because we knew, actually, that y
  is held</span> <span m='2261000'>constant. Now, the real difficulty in</span> <span
  m='2264000'>both cases comes from dx. And what we do about dx is we</span> <span
  m='2268000'>use the constant. Here we use it by writing dg</span> <span m='2272000'>equals
  zero. Here we write the chain rule</span> <span m='2275000'>for g, which is the
  same thing, just divided by dz with y held</span> <span m='2280000'>constant. This
  formula or that formula</span> <span m='2283000'>are the same, just divided by dz
  with y held</span> <span m='2287000'>constant. And then, in both cases,</span> <span
  m='2291000'>we used that to solve for dx. And then we plugged into the</span> <span
  m='2296000'>formula of df to express df over dz, or partial f,</span> <span m='2301000'>partial
  z with y held constant. So, the two methods are pretty</span> <span m='2306000'>much
  the same. Quick poll.</span> <span m='2307000'>Who prefers this one? Who prefers
  that one?</span> <span m='2313000'>OK. Majority vote seems to be for</span> <span
  m='2314000'>differentials, but it doesn't mean that it is</span> <span m='2316000'>better.
  Both are fine.</span> <span m='2319000'>You can use whichever one you want.</span>
  <span m='2322000'>But you should give both a try. OK. Any questions?</span> <span
  m='2330000'>Yes? Yes. Thank you.</span> <span m='2338000'>I forgot to mention it.
  Where did that go?</span> <span m='2342000'>I think I erased that part. We need
  to know -- --</span> <span m='2351000'>directional derivatives. Pretty much the
  only thing to</span> <span m='2360000'>remember about them is that df over ds,</span>
  <span m='2363000'>in the direction of some unit vector u,</span> <span m='2365000'>is
  just the gradient f dot product with u.</span> <span m='2370000'>That is pretty
  much all we know about them.</span> <span m='2375000'>Any other topics that I forgot
  to list?</span> <span m='2379000'>No. Yes?</span> <span m='2385000'>Can I erase
  three boards at a time?</span> <span m='2386000'>No, I would need three hands to
  do that.</span> <span m='2403000'>I think what we should do now is look quickly
  at the practice</span> <span m='2407000'>test. I mean, given the time,</span> <span
  m='2410000'>you will mostly have to think about it yourselves.</span> <span m='2415000'>Hopefully
  you have a copy of the practice exam.</span> <span m='2423000'>The first problem
  is a simple problem.</span> <span m='2426000'>Find the gradient. Find an approximation
  formula.</span> <span m='2428000'>Hopefully you know how to do that.</span> <span
  m='2430000'>The second problem is one about writing a contour plot.</span> <span
  m='2433000'>And so, before I let you go for the weekend, I want to make sure</span>
  <span m='2441000'>that you actually know how to read a contour plot.</span> <span
  m='2447000'>One thing I should mention is this problem asks you to</span> <span
  m='2451000'>estimate partial derivatives by writing a contour plot.</span> <span
  m='2455000'>We have not done that, so that will not actually be on</span> <span
  m='2457000'>the test. We will be doing qualitative</span> <span m='2459000'>questions
  like what is the sine of a partial derivative.</span> <span m='2461000'>Is it zero,
  less than zero or more than zero?</span> <span m='2464000'>You don't need to bring
  a ruler to estimate partial derivatives</span> <span m='2467000'>the way that this
  problem asks you to.</span> <span m='2495000'>[APPLAUSE] Let's look at problem 2B.</span>
  <span m='2498000'>Problem 2B is asking you to find the point at which h equals</span>
  <span m='2503000'>2200, partial h over partial x equals</span> <span m='2506000'>zero
  and partial h over partial y is less than zero.</span> <span m='2509000'>Let's try
  and see what is going on here.</span> <span m='2513000'>A point where f equals 2200,
  well, that should be probably</span> <span m='2517000'>on the level curve that says
  2200.</span> <span m='2519000'>We can actually zoom in. Here is the level 2200.</span>
  <span m='2529000'>Now I want partial h over partial x to be zero.</span> <span m='2532000'>That
  means if I change x, keeping y constant,</span> <span m='2537000'>the value of h
  doesn't change. Which points on the level curve</span> <span m='2544000'>satisfy
  that property? It is the top and the bottom.</span> <span m='2550000'>If you are
  here, for example, and you move in the x</span> <span m='2554000'>direction, well,
  you see,</span> <span m='2556000'>as you get to there from the left,</span> <span
  m='2558000'>the height first increases and then decreases.</span> <span m='2561000'>It
  goes for a maximum at that point.</span> <span m='2564000'>So, at that point, the
  partial derivative is zero</span> <span m='2567000'>with respect to x. And the same
  here.</span> <span m='2573000'>Now, let's find partial h over partial y less than
  zero.</span> <span m='2579000'>That means if we go north we should go down.</span>
  <span m='2583000'>Well, which one is it, top or bottom?</span> <span m='2587000'>Top.
  Yes. Here, if you go north,</span> <span m='2591000'>then you go from 2200 down
  to 2100.</span> <span m='2596000'>This is where the point is. Now, the problem here
  was also</span> <span m='2603000'>asking you to estimate partial h over partial
  y.</span> <span m='2605000'>And if you were curious how you would do that,</span>
  <span m='2608000'>well, you would try to figure out how long it takes before you</span>
  <span m='2613000'>reach the next level curve. To go from here to here,</span> <span
  m='2622000'>to go from Q to this new point, say Q prime,</span> <span m='2627000'>the
  change in y, well, you would have to read</span> <span m='2629000'>the scale, which
  was down here,</span> <span m='2636000'>would be about something like 300.</span>
  <span m='2640000'>What is the change in height when you go from Q to Q prime?</span>
  <span m='2644000'>Well, you go down from 2200 to 2100.</span> <span m='2647000'>That
  is actually minus 100 exactly.</span> <span m='2654000'>OK? And so delta h over
  delta y is</span> <span m='2659000'>about minus one-third, well, minus 100 over
  300 which</span> <span m='2667000'>is minus one-third. And that is an approximation</span>
  <span m='2675000'>for partial derivative. So, that is how you would do it.</span>
  <span m='2683000'>Now, let me go back to other things.</span> <span m='2688000'>If
  you look at this practice exam, basically there is a bit</span> <span m='2692000'>of
  everything and it is kind of fairly representative of what</span> <span m='2696000'>might
  happen on Tuesday. There will be a mix of easy</span> <span m='2700000'>problems
  and of harder problems. Expect something about</span> <span m='2703000'>computing
  gradients, approximations,</span> <span m='2705000'>rate of change. Expect a problem
  about reading</span> <span m='2708000'>a contour plot. Expect one about a min/max</span>
  <span m='2713000'>problem, something about Lagrange</span> <span m='2715000'>multipliers,
  something about the chain rule</span> <span m='2717000'>and something about constrained
  partial derivatives.</span> <span m='2720000'>I mean pretty much all the topics
  are going to be there.</span> </p>
