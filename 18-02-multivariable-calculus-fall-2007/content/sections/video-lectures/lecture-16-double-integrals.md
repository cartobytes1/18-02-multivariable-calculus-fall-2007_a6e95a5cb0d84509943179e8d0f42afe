  at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m=''23000''>So, basically the last few weeks, we''ve
  been doing</span> <span m=''27000''>derivatives. Now, we''re going to integrals.</span>
  <span m=''33000''>So -- OK, so more precisely, we are going to be talking</span>
  <span m=''46000''>about double integrals. OK, so just to motivate the</span> <span
  m=''58000''>notion, let me just remind you that</span> <span m=''64000''>when you
  have a function of one variable -- -- say,</span> <span m=''71000''>f of x, and
  you take its integrals</span> <span m=''76000''>from, say, a to b of f of x dx,</span>
  <span m=''81000''>well, that corresponds to the area below the graph of f over</span>
  <span m=''93000''>the interval from a to b. OK, so the picture is something</span>
  <span m=''103000''>like you have a; you have b.</span> <span m=''107000''>You have
  the graph of f, and then what the integral</span> <span m=''115000''>measures is
  the area of this region.</span> <span m=''122000''>And, when we say the area of
  this region, of course,</span> <span m=''124000''>if f is positive, that''s what
  happens.</span> <span m=''126000''>If f is negative, then we count negatively the</span>
  <span m=''131000''>area below the x axis. OK, so, now,</span> <span m=''135000''>when
  you have a function of two variables, then you can try to</span> <span m=''139000''>do
  the same thing. Namely, you can plot its graph.</span> <span m=''142000''>Its graph
  will be a surface in space.</span> <span m=''144000''>And then, we can try to look
  for the volume below the graph.</span> <span m=''148000''>And that''s what we will
  call the double integral of the</span> <span m=''155000''>function over a certain
  region. OK, so let''s say that we have a</span> <span m=''164000''>function of two
  variables, x and y.</span> <span m=''171000''>Then, we''ll look at the volume that''s
  below the graph z equals</span> <span m=''180000''>f of xy. OK, so, let''s draw
  a picture</span> <span m=''186000''>for what this means. I have a function of x
  and y.</span> <span m=''190000''>I can draw its graph. The graph will be the surface</span>
  <span m=''196000''>with equation z equals f of x and y.</span> <span m=''200000''>And,
  well, I have to decide where I will integrate the</span> <span m=''204000''>function.
  So, for that,</span> <span m=''206000''>I will choose some region in the xy plane.</span>
  <span m=''210000''>And, I will integrate the function on that region.</span> <span
  m=''219000''>So, it''s over a region, R, in the xy plane.</span> <span m=''226000''>So,
  I have this region R and I look at the piece of the graph</span> <span m=''231000''>that
  is above this region. And, we''ll try to compute the</span> <span m=''236000''>volume
  of this solid here. OK, that''s what the double</span> <span m=''242000''>integral
  will measure. So, we''ll call that the double</span> <span m=''248000''>integral
  of our region, R, of f of xy dA and I will</span> <span m=''253000''>have to explain
  what the notation means.</span> <span m=''258000''>So, dA here stands for a piece
  of area.</span> <span m=''262000''>A stands for area. And, well, it''s a double</span>
  <span m=''266000''>integral. So, that''s why we have two</span> <span m=''268000''>integral
  signs. And, we''ll have to indicate</span> <span m=''270000''>somehow the region
  over which we are integrating.</span> <span m=''273000''>OK, we''ll come up with
  more concrete notations when we see</span> <span m=''277000''>how to actually compute
  these things.</span> <span m=''279000''>That''s the basic definition. OK, so actually,</span>
  <span m=''284000''>how do we define it, that''s not really much of a</span> <span
  m=''285000''>definition yet. How do we actually define this</span> <span m=''289000''>rigorously?
  Well, remember,</span> <span m=''292000''>the integral in one variable, you probably
  saw a definition</span> <span m=''296000''>where you take your integral from a to
  b,</span> <span m=''298000''>and you cut it into little pieces.</span> <span m=''301000''>And
  then, for each little piece, you take the value of a</span> <span m=''303000''>function,
  and you multiply by the width of a piece.</span> <span m=''306000''>That gives you
  a rectangular slice, and then you sum all of</span> <span m=''311000''>these rectangular
  slices together.</span> <span m=''314000''>So, here we''ll do the same thing.</span>
  <span m=''317000''>So, well, let me put a picture up and explain what it does.</span>
  <span m=''323000''>So, we''re going to cut our origin into little pieces,</span>
  <span m=''326000''>say, little rectangles or actually anything we want.</span> <span
  m=''330000''>And then, for each piece, with the small area, delta A,</span> <span
  m=''335000''>we''ll take the area delta a times the value of a function in</span>
  <span m=''339000''>there that will give us the volume of a small box that sits</span>
  <span m=''343000''>under the graph. And then, we''ll add all these</span> <span
  m=''346000''>boxes together. That gives us an estimate of a</span> <span m=''349000''>volume.
  And then, to get actually the</span> <span m=''351000''>integral, the integral will
  be defined as</span> <span m=''353000''>a limit as we subdivide into smaller and
  smaller boxes,</span> <span m=''356000''>and we sum more and more pieces,</span>
  <span m=''359000''>OK? So, actually,</span> <span m=''362000''>what we do, oh, I
  still have a board here.</span> <span m=''371000''>So, the actual definition involves
  cutting R into small</span> <span m=''380000''>pieces of area that''s called delta
  A or maybe delta Ai,</span> <span m=''389000''>the area of the i''th piece. And
  then, OK,</span> <span m=''396000''>so maybe in the xy plane, we have our region,</span>
  <span m=''402000''>and we''ll cut it may be using some grade.</span> <span m=''407000''>OK,
  and then we''ll have each small piece.</span> <span m=''409000''>Each small piece
  will have area delta Ai and it will be at some</span> <span m=''420000''>point,
  let''s call it xi, yi ...</span> <span m=''426000''>yi, xi. And then, we''ll consider
  the</span> <span m=''433000''>sum over all the pieces of f at that point, xi,</span>
  <span m=''438000''>yi times the area of a small piece.</span> <span m=''442000''>So,
  what that corresponds to in the three-dimensional picture is</span> <span m=''447000''>just
  I sum the volumes of all of these little columns that sit</span> <span m=''451000''>under
  the graph. OK, and then,</span> <span m=''456000''>so what I do is actually I take
  the limit as the size of the</span> <span m=''469000''>pieces tends to zero. So,
  I have more and more</span> <span m=''477000''>smaller and smaller pieces. And,
  that gives me the double</span> <span m=''483000''>integral. OK, so that''s not
  a very good</span> <span m=''487000''>sentence, but whatever. So, OK, so that''s
  the</span> <span m=''493000''>definition. Of course, we will have to see</span>
  <span m=''496000''>how to compute it. We don''t actually compute it.</span> <span
  m=''499000''>When you compute an integral in single variable calculus,</span> <span
  m=''501000''>you don''t do that. You don''t cut into little</span> <span m=''503000''>pieces
  and sum the pieces together.</span> <span m=''505000''>You''ve learned how to integrate
  functions using various</span> <span m=''508000''>formulas, and similarly here,</span>
  <span m=''509000''>we''ll learn how to actually compute these things without</span>
  <span m=''512000''>doing that cutting into small pieces.</span> <span m=''514000''>OK,
  any questions first about the concept, or what the</span> <span m=''518000''>definition
  is? Yes?</span> <span m=''528000''>Well, so we''ll have to learn which tricks work,</span>
  <span m=''530000''>and how exactly. But, so what we''ll do actually</span> <span
  m=''532000''>is we''ll reduce the calculation of a double integral to two</span>
  <span m=''536000''>calculations of single integrals.</span> <span m=''538000''>And
  so, for V, certainly, all the tricks</span> <span m=''540000''>you''ve learned in
  single variable calculus will come in</span> <span m=''543000''>handy. OK, so,</span>
  <span m=''545000''>yeah that''s a strong suggestion that if you''ve forgotten</span>
  <span m=''547000''>everything about single variable calculus,</span> <span m=''549000''>now
  would be a good time to actually brush up on integrals.</span> <span m=''557000''>The
  usual integrals, and the usual substitution</span> <span m=''561000''>tricks and
  easy trig in particular, these would be very</span> <span m=''566000''>useful. OK,
  so, yeah,</span> <span m=''568000''>how do we compute these things? That''s what
  we would have to</span> <span m=''571000''>come up with. And, well,</span> <span
  m=''577000''>going back to what we did with derivatives,</span> <span m=''579000''>to
  understand variations of functions and derivatives,</span> <span m=''582000''>what
  we did was really we took slices parallel to an axis or</span> <span m=''585000''>another
  one. So, in fact,</span> <span m=''586000''>here, the key is also the same. So,
  what we are going to do is</span> <span m=''590000''>instead of cutting into a lot
  of small boxes like that and</span> <span m=''592000''>summing completely at random,
  we will actually somehow scan</span> <span m=''597000''>through our region by parallel
  planes,</span> <span m=''601000''>OK? So, let me put up,</span> <span m=''603000''>actually,
  a slightly different picture up here.</span> <span m=''608000''>So, what I''m going
  to do is I''m going to take planes,</span> <span m=''611000''>say in this picture,
  parallel to the yz plane.</span> <span m=''614000''>I''ll take a moving plane that
  scans from the back to the front</span> <span m=''618000''>or from the front to
  the back. So, that means I set the value</span> <span m=''623000''>of x, and I look
  at the slice, x equals x0,</span> <span m=''627000''>and then I will do that for
  all values of x0.</span> <span m=''631000''>So, now in each slice, well, I get what
  looks a lot</span> <span m=''635000''>like a single variable integral. OK, and that
  integral will tell</span> <span m=''640000''>me, what is the area in this? Well,
  I guess it''s supposed to</span> <span m=''644000''>be green, but it all comes as
  black, so, let''s say the black</span> <span m=''648000''>shaded slice. And then,
  when I add all of</span> <span m=''651000''>these areas together, as the value of
  x changes,</span> <span m=''655000''>I will get the volume. OK, let me try to explain
  that</span> <span m=''660000''>again. So, to compute this integral,</span> <span
  m=''667000''>what we do is actually we take slices.</span> <span m=''676000''>So,
  let''s consider, let''s call s of x the area of a</span> <span m=''689000''>slice,
  well, by a plane parallel to the yz plane.</span> <span m=''701000''>OK, so on the
  picture, s of x is just the area of this</span> <span m=''706000''>thing in the
  vertical wall. Now, if you sum all of these,</span> <span m=''711000''>well, why
  does that work? So, if you take the origin</span> <span m=''715000''>between two
  parallel slices that are very close to each other,</span> <span m=''719000''>what''s
  the volume in these two things?</span> <span m=''721000''>Well, it''s essentially
  s of x times the thickness of this very</span> <span m=''725000''>thin slice, and
  the thickness would be</span> <span m=''729000''>delta x0 dx if you take a limit
  with more and more slices.</span> <span m=''736000''>OK, so the volume will be the
  integral of s of x dx from,</span> <span m=''745000''>well, what should be the range
  for x?</span> <span m=''752000''>Well, we would have to start at the very lowest
  value of x that</span> <span m=''755000''>ever happens in our origin, and we''d
  have to go all the way</span> <span m=''759000''>to the very largest value of x,
  from the very far back to the</span> <span m=''763000''>very far front. So, in this
  picture,</span> <span m=''768000''>we probably start over here at the back, and
  we''d end over here</span> <span m=''777000''>at the front. So, let me just say
  from the</span> <span m=''785000''>minimum, x, to the maximum x. And now, how do
  we find S of x?</span> <span m=''793000''>Well, S of x will be actually again an
  integral.</span> <span m=''797000''>But now, it''s an integral of the variable,</span>
  <span m=''800000''>y, because when we look at this slice, what changes from left
  to</span> <span m=''805000''>right is y. So, well let me actually write</span> <span
  m=''815000''>that down. For a given,</span> <span m=''820000''>x, the area S of
  x you can compute as an integral of f of</span> <span m=''828000''>x, y dy. OK,
  well, now x is a constant,</span> <span m=''832000''>and y will be the variable
  of integration.</span> <span m=''836000''>What''s the range for y? Well, it''s from
  the leftmost</span> <span m=''840000''>point here to the rightmost point here on
  the given slice.</span> <span m=''846000''>So, there is a big catch here. That''s
  a very important thing</span> <span m=''850000''>to remember. What is the range
  of</span> <span m=''852000''>integration? The range of integration for y</span>
  <span m=''854000''>depends actually on x. See, if I take the slice that''s</span>
  <span m=''858000''>pictured on that diagram, then the range for y goes all</span>
  <span m=''862000''>the way from the very left to the very right.</span> <span m=''866000''>But,
  if I take a slice that, say, near the very front,</span> <span m=''870000''>then
  in fact, only a very small segment of it</span> <span m=''872000''>will be in my
  region. So, the range of values for y</span> <span m=''876000''>will be much less.
  Let me actually draw a 2D</span> <span m=''881000''>picture for that. So, remember,</span>
  <span m=''885000''>we fix x, so, sorry, so we fix a value of x.</span> <span m=''891000''>OK,
  and for a given value of x, what we will do is we''ll slice</span> <span m=''895000''>our
  graph by this plane parallel to the yz plane.</span> <span m=''899000''>So, now
  we mention the graph is sitting above that.</span> <span m=''902000''>OK, that''s
  the region R. We have the region,</span> <span m=''906000''>R, and I have the graph
  of a function above this region,</span> <span m=''912000''>R. And, I''m trying to
  find the</span> <span m=''915000''>area between this segment and the graph above
  it in this</span> <span m=''920000''>vertical plane. Well, to do that,</span> <span
  m=''924000''>I have to integrate from y going from here to here.</span> <span m=''933000''>I
  want the area of a piece that sits above this red segment.</span> <span m=''937000''>And,
  so in particular, the endpoints,</span> <span m=''940000''>the extreme values for
  y depend on x because,</span> <span m=''943000''>see, if I slice here instead,</span>
  <span m=''947000''>well, my bounds for y will be smaller.</span> <span m=''954000''>OK,
  so now, if I put the two things together,</span> <span m=''959000''>what I will
  get -- -- is actually a formula where I have</span> <span m=''975000''>to integrate
  -- -- over x -- -- an integral over y.</span> <span m=''990000''>OK, and so this
  is called an iterated integral because we</span> <span m=''1002000''>iterate twice
  the process of taking an integral.</span> <span m=''1014000''>OK, so again, what''s
  important to realize</span> <span m=''1017000''>here, I mean, I''m going to say
  that</span> <span m=''1019000''>several times over the next few days but that''s
  because it''s the</span> <span m=''1022000''>single most important thing to remember
  about double integrals,</span> <span m=''1025000''>the bounds here are just going
  to be numbers,</span> <span m=''1029000''>OK, because the question I''m asking myself
  here is,</span> <span m=''1032000''>what is the first value of x by which I might
  want to slice,</span> <span m=''1035000''>and what is the last value of x? Which
  range of x do I want to</span> <span m=''1041000''>look at to take my red slices?
  And, the answer is I would go</span> <span m=''1045000''>all the way from here,
  that''s my first slice,</span> <span m=''1049000''>to somewhere here. That''s my
  last slice.</span> <span m=''1054000''>For any value in between these, I will have
  some red segment,</span> <span m=''1058000''>and I will want to integrate over that
  that.</span> <span m=''1060000''>On the other hand here, the bounds will depend
  on the</span> <span m=''1065000''>outer variable, x,</span> <span m=''1067000''>because
  at a fixed value of x, what the values of y will be</span> <span m=''1074000''>depends
  on x in general. OK, so I think we should do</span> <span m=''1081000''>lots of
  examples to convince ourselves and see how it works.</span> <span m=''1091000''>Yeah,
  it''s called an iterated integral because first we</span> <span m=''1095000''>integrated
  over y, and then we integrate again</span> <span m=''1098000''>over x, OK? So, we
  can do that,</span> <span m=''1100000''>well, I mean, y depends on x or x depends,</span>
  <span m=''1103000''>no, actually x and y vary independently of each other</span>
  <span m=''1107000''>inside here. What is more complicated is how</span> <span m=''1111000''>the
  bounds on y depend on x. But actually,</span> <span m=''1114000''>you could also
  do the other way around: first integrate over x,</span> <span m=''1117000''>and
  then over y, and then the bounds for x will</span> <span m=''1119000''>depend on
  y. We''ll see that on an example.</span> <span m=''1122000''>Yes? So, for y, I''m
  using the range</span> <span m=''1133000''>of values for y that corresponds to the
  given value of x,</span> <span m=''1138000''>OK? Remember, this is just like a</span>
  <span m=''1140000''>plot in the xy plane. Above that, we have the graph.</span>
  <span m=''1144000''>Maybe I should draw a picture here instead.</span> <span m=''1146000''>For
  a given value of x, so that''s a given slice,</span> <span m=''1149000''>I have
  a range of values for y, that is,</span> <span m=''1153000''>from this picture at
  the leftmost point on that slice to</span> <span m=''1156000''>the rightmost point
  on that slice.</span> <span m=''1159000''>So, where start and where I stop depends
  on the value of x.</span> <span m=''1164000''>Does that make sense? OK.</span> <span
  m=''1173000''>OK, no more questions? OK, so let''s do our first</span> <span m=''1185000''>example.
  So, let''s say that we want to</span> <span m=''1192000''>integrate the function
  1-x^2-y^2 over the region defined by x</span> <span m=''1200000''>between 0 and
  1, and y between 0 and 1.</span> <span m=''1206000''>So, what does that mean geometrically?</span>
  <span m=''1209000''>Well, z = 1-x^2-y^2, and it''s a variation on,</span> <span
  m=''1213000''>actually I think we plotted that one, right?</span> <span m=''1217000''>That
  was our first example of a function of two variables</span> <span m=''1222000''>possibly.
  And, so, we saw that the graph</span> <span m=''1224000''>is this paraboloid pointing
  downwards.</span> <span m=''1227000''>OK, it''s what you get by taking a parabola
  and rotating it.</span> <span m=''1231000''>And now, what we are asking is, what
  is the volume between the</span> <span m=''1235000''>paraboloid and the xy plane
  over the square of side one in the xy</span> <span m=''1240000''>plane over the
  square of side one in the xy plane,</span> <span m=''1243000''>x and y between zero
  and one. OK, so, what we''ll do is we''ll,</span> <span m=''1249000''>so, see, here
  I try to represent the square.</span> <span m=''1254000''>And, we''ll just sum the
  areas of the slices as,</span> <span m=''1259000''>say, x varies from zero to one.
  And here, of course,</span> <span m=''1263000''>setting up the bounds will be easy
  because no matter what x I</span> <span m=''1266000''>take, y still goes from zero
  to one.</span> <span m=''1268000''>See, it''s easiest to do double integrals what
  the region is</span> <span m=''1273000''>just a rectangle on the xy plane because
  then you don''t have to</span> <span m=''1278000''>worry too much about what are
  the ranges.</span> <span m=''1281000''>OK, so let''s do it. Well, that would be
  the</span> <span m=''1289000''>integral from zero to one of the integral from zero
  to one of</span> <span m=''1298000''>1-x^2-y^2 dy dx. So, I''m dropping the</span>
  <span m=''1302000''>parentheses. But, if you still want to see</span> <span m=''1304000''>them,
  I''m going to put that in very thin so that you see what</span> <span m=''1308000''>it
  means. But, actually,</span> <span m=''1310000''>the convention is we won''t put
  this parentheses in there</span> <span m=''1313000''>anymore. OK, so what this means
  is first</span> <span m=''1317000''>I will integrate 1-x^2-y^2 over y, ranging from
  zero to one with</span> <span m=''1322000''>x held fixed. So, what that represents
  is the</span> <span m=''1327000''>area in this slice. So, see here,</span> <span
  m=''1330000''>I''ve drawn, well, what happens is actually the</span> <span m=''1333000''>function
  takes positive and negative values.</span> <span m=''1336000''>So, in fact, I will
  be counting positively</span> <span m=''1338000''>this part of the area. And, I
  will be counting</span> <span m=''1341000''>negatively this part of the area, I
  mean,</span> <span m=''1345000''>as usual when I do an integral. OK, so what I will
  do to</span> <span m=''1352000''>evaluate this, I will first do what''s called</span>
  <span m=''1360000''>the inner integral. So, to do the inner integral,</span> <span
  m=''1368000''>well, it''s pretty easy. How do I integrate this?</span> <span m=''1375000''>Well,
  it becomes, so, what''s the integral of one?</span> <span m=''1378000''>It''s y.
  Just anything to remember is we</span> <span m=''1381000''>are integrating this
  with respect to y,</span> <span m=''1383000''>not to x. The integral of x^2 is x^2</span>
  <span m=''1388000''>times y. And, the integral of y^2 is y^3</span> <span m=''1394000''>over
  3. OK, and that we plug in the</span> <span m=''1398000''>bounds, which are zero
  and one in this case.</span> <span m=''1401000''>And so, when you plug y equals
  one, you will get one minus x^2</span> <span m=''1408000''>minus one third minus,
  well, for y equals zero you get</span> <span m=''1414000''>0,0, 0, so nothing changes.
  OK, so you are left with two</span> <span m=''1421000''>thirds minus x^2. OK, and
  that''s a function of x</span> <span m=''1425000''>only. Here, you shouldn''t see
  any y''s</span> <span m=''1427000''>anymore because y was your integration variable.</span>
  <span m=''1429000''>But, you still have x. You still have x because the</span> <span
  m=''1435000''>area of this shaded slice depends, of course,</span> <span m=''1441000''>on
  the value of x. And, so now,</span> <span m=''1445000''>the second thing to do is
  to do the outer integral.</span> <span m=''1451000''>So, now we integrate from zero
  to one what we got,</span> <span m=''1457000''>which is two thirds minus x^2 dx.</span>
  <span m=''1462000''>OK, and we know how to compute that because that integrates
  to</span> <span m=''1466000''>two thirds x minus one third x^3 between zero and
  one.</span> <span m=''1471000''>And, I''ll let you do the computation.</span> <span
  m=''1473000''>You will find it''s one third. OK, so that''s the final answer.</span>
  <span m=''1483000''>So, that''s the general pattern. When we have a double integral</span>
  <span m=''1486000''>to compute, first we want to set it up carefully.</span> <span
  m=''1489000''>We want to find, what will be the bounds in x</span> <span m=''1491000''>and
  y? And here, that was actually</span> <span m=''1493000''>pretty easy because our
  equation was very simple.</span> <span m=''1497000''>Then, we want to compute the
  inner integral,</span> <span m=''1500000''>and then we compute the outer integral.</span>
  <span m=''1502000''>And, that''s it. OK, any questions at this point?</span> <span
  m=''1511000''>No? OK, so, by the way,</span> <span m=''1516000''>we started with
  dA in the notation, right?</span> <span m=''1520000''>Here we had dA. And, that
  somehow became a dy</span> <span m=''1526000''>dx. OK,</span> <span m=''1528000''>so,
  dA became dy dx because when we</span> <span m=''1535000''>do the iterated integral
  this way,</span> <span m=''1539000''>what we''re actually doing is that we are slicing
  our origin</span> <span m=''1545000''>into small rectangles. OK, that was the area
  of this</span> <span m=''1549000''>small rectangle here? Well, it''s the product
  of its</span> <span m=''1552000''>width times its height. So, that''s delta x times
  delta</span> <span m=''1558000''>y. OK, so, delta a equals delta x</span> <span
  m=''1563000''>delta y becomes... So actually,</span> <span m=''1568000''>it''s not
  just becomes, it''s really equal.</span> <span m=''1578000''>So, the small rectangles
  for. Now, it became dy dx and not dx</span> <span m=''1588000''>dy. Well, that''s
  a question of,</span> <span m=''1590000''>in which order we do the iterated integral?</span>
  <span m=''1592000''>It''s up to us to decide whether we want to integrate x first,</span>
  <span m=''1596000''>then y, or y first, then x.</span> <span m=''1598000''>But,
  as we''ll see very soon, that is an important decision</span> <span m=''1601000''>when
  it comes to setting up the bounds of integration.</span> <span m=''1604000''>Here,
  it doesn''t matter, but in general we have to be</span> <span m=''1607000''>very
  careful about in which order we will do things.</span> <span m=''1611000''>Yes?
  Well, in principle it always</span> <span m=''1617000''>works both ways. Sometimes
  it will be that</span> <span m=''1620000''>because the region has a strange shape,
  you can actually set it</span> <span m=''1624000''>up more easily one way or the
  other.</span> <span m=''1626000''>Sometimes it will also be that the function here,</span>
  <span m=''1629000''>you actually know how to integrate in one way,</span> <span
  m=''1632000''>but not the other. So, the theory is that it</span> <span m=''1635000''>should
  work both ways. In practice,</span> <span m=''1638000''>one of the two calculations
  may be much harder.</span> <span m=''1645000''>OK. Let''s do another example.</span>
  <span m=''1653000''>Let''s say that what I wanted to know was not actually what
  I</span> <span m=''1659000''>computed, namely, the volume below the</span> <span
  m=''1662000''>paraboloid, but also the negative of some</span> <span m=''1665000''>part
  that''s now in the corner towards me.</span> <span m=''1668000''>But let''s say
  really what I wanted was just the volume</span> <span m=''1671000''>between the
  paraboloid and the xy plane,</span> <span m=''1674000''>so looking only at the part
  of it that sits above the xy plane.</span> <span m=''1678000''>So, that means, instead
  of integrating over the</span> <span m=''1681000''>entire square of size one, I
  should just integrate over</span> <span m=''1685000''>the quarter disk. I should
  stop integrating where</span> <span m=''1688000''>my paraboloid hits the xy plane.
  So, let me draw another picture.</span> <span m=''1698000''>So, let''s say I wanted
  to integrate, actually -- So,</span> <span m=''1708000''>let''s call this example
  two. So, we are going to do the same</span> <span m=''1716000''>function but over
  a different region.</span> <span m=''1719000''>And, the region will just be, now,
  this quarter disk here.</span> <span m=''1724000''>OK, so maybe I should draw a
  picture on the xy plane.</span> <span m=''1735000''>That''s your region, R. OK,
  so in principle,</span> <span m=''1754000''>it will be the same integral. But what
  changes is the bounds.</span> <span m=''1759000''>Why do the bounds change? Well,
  the bounds change because</span> <span m=''1763000''>now if I set, if I fixed some
  value of x,</span> <span m=''1767000''>then I want to integrate this part of the
  slice that''s above</span> <span m=''1771000''>the xy plane and I don''t want to
  take this part that''s actually</span> <span m=''1776000''>outside of my disk. So,
  I should stop integrating</span> <span m=''1779000''>over y when y reaches this
  value here.</span> <span m=''1782000''>OK, on that picture here, on this picture,</span>
  <span m=''1786000''>it tells me for a fixed value of x, the range of values for
  y</span> <span m=''1792000''>should go only from here to here.</span> <span m=''1795000''>So,
  that''s from here to less than one.</span> <span m=''1800000''>OK, so for a given,
  x, the range of y is,</span> <span m=''1807000''>well, so what''s the lowest value
  of y that we want to look</span> <span m=''1816000''>at? It''s still zero.</span>
  <span m=''1820000''>From y equals zero to,what''s the value of y here?</span> <span
  m=''1824000''>Well, I have to solve in the equation of a circle,</span> <span m=''1828000''>OK?
  So, if I''m here,</span> <span m=''1831000''>this is x^2 y^2 equals one. That means
  y is square root of</span> <span m=''1839000''>one minus x^2. OK, so I will integrate
  from y</span> <span m=''1844000''>equals zero to y equals square root of one minus
  x^2.</span> <span m=''1848000''>And, now you see how the bound from y will depend
  on the value</span> <span m=''1855000''>of x. OK, so while I erase,</span> <span
  m=''1859000''>I will let you think about, what is the bound for x now?</span> <span
  m=''1865000''>It''s a trick question.</span> <span m=''1895000''>OK, so I claim
  that what we will do -- We write this as an</span> <span m=''1908000''>iterated
  integral first dy then dx.</span> <span m=''1917000''>And, we said for a fixed value
  of x, the range for y is from</span> <span m=''1924000''>zero to square root of
  one minus x^2.</span> <span m=''1929000''>What about the range for x? Well, the
  range for x should</span> <span m=''1933000''>just be numbers. OK, remember,</span>
  <span m=''1935000''>the question I have to ask now is if I look at all of these</span>
  <span m=''1938000''>yellow slices, which one is the first one that</span> <span
  m=''1941000''>I will consider? Which one is the last one that</span> <span m=''1944000''>I
  want to consider? So, the smallest value of x</span> <span m=''1947000''>that I
  want to consider is zero again.</span> <span m=''1950000''>And then, I will have
  actually a pretty big slice.</span> <span m=''1953000''>And I will get smaller,
  and smaller,</span> <span m=''1955000''>and smaller slices. And, it stops.</span>
  <span m=''1956000''>I have to stop when x equals one.</span> <span m=''1959000''>Afterwards,
  there''s nothing else to integrate.</span> <span m=''1962000''>So, x goes from zero
  to one. OK, and now,</span> <span m=''1969000''>see how in the inner integral, the
  bounds depend on in the</span> <span m=''1972000''>inner integral, the bounds depend
  on x.</span> <span m=''1975000''>In the outer one, you just get numbers because</span>
  <span m=''1978000''>the questions that you have to ask to set up this one and set</span>
  <span m=''1982000''>up that one are different. Here, the question is,</span> <span
  m=''1985000''>if I fix a given, x, if I look at a given slice,</span> <span m=''1987000''>what''s
  the range for y? Here, the question is,</span> <span m=''1990000''>what''s the first
  slice? What is the last slice?</span> <span m=''1996000''>Does that make sense?
  Everyone happy with that?</span> <span m=''2001000''>OK, very good. So, now, how
  do we compute that?</span> <span m=''2008000''>Well, we do the inner integral. So,
  that''s an integral from</span> <span m=''2016000''>zero to square root of one minus
  x^2 of one minus x^2 minus y^2</span> <span m=''2022000''>dy. And, well, that integrates
  to</span> <span m=''2028000''>y-x^2y-y^3 over three from zero to square root of
  one minus x^2.</span> <span m=''2040000''>And then, that becomes, well, the root
  of one minus x^2</span> <span m=''2046000''>minus x^2 root of one minus x^2 minus
  y minus x^2 to the three</span> <span m=''2053000''>halves over three. And actually,</span>
  <span m=''2056000''>if you look at it for long enough, see, this says one minus</span>
  <span m=''2060000''>x^2 times square root of one minus x^2.</span> <span m=''2063000''>So,
  actually, that''s also,</span> <span m=''2066000''>so, in fact, that simplifies
  to two thirds</span> <span m=''2070000''>of one minus x^2 to the three halves.</span>
  <span m=''2075000''>OK, let me redo that, maybe, slightly differently.</span> <span
  m=''2080000''>This was one minus x^2 times y. So -- -- one minus x^2 times y</span>
  <span m=''2090000''>becomes square root of one minus x^2 minus y^3 over three.</span>
  <span m=''2102000''>And then, when I take y equals zero, I get zero.</span> <span
  m=''2104000''>So, I don''t subtract anything. OK, so now you see this is one</span>
  <span m=''2108000''>minus x^2 to the three halves minus a third of it.</span> <span
  m=''2111000''>So, you''re left with two thirds. OK, so, that''s the integral.</span>
  <span m=''2121000''>The outer integral is the integral from zero to one of two</span>
  <span m=''2127000''>thirds of one minus x^2 to the three halves dx.</span> <span
  m=''2131000''>And, well,</span> <span m=''2137000''>I let you see if you remember
  single variable integrals by</span> <span m=''2142000''>trying to figure out what
  this actually comes out to be is it</span> <span m=''2147000''>pi over two, or pi
  over eight, actually?</span> <span m=''2154000''>I think it''s pi over eight. OK,
  well I guess we have to do</span> <span m=''2172000''>it then. I wrote something
  on my notes,</span> <span m=''2175000''>but it''s not very clear, OK?</span> <span
  m=''2176000''>So, how do we compute this thing?</span> <span m=''2178000''>Well,
  we have to do trig substitution.</span> <span m=''2180000''>That''s the only way
  I know to compute an integral like that,</span> <span m=''2184000''>OK? So, we''ll
  set x equal sine</span> <span m=''2187000''>theta, and then square root of one minus
  x^2 will be cosine</span> <span m=''2195000''>theta. We are using sine squared plus</span>
  <span m=''2201000''>cosine squared equals one. And, so that will become -- --</span>
  <span m=''2211000''>so, two thirds remains two thirds.</span> <span m=''2219000''>One
  minus x^2 to the three halves becomes cosine cubed</span> <span m=''2224000''>theta.
  dx, well, if x is sine theta,</span> <span m=''2228000''>then dx is cosine theta
  d theta.</span> <span m=''2233000''>So, that''s cosine theta d theta. And,</span>
  <span m=''2237000''>well, if you do things with substitution,</span> <span m=''2239000''>which
  is the way I do them, then you should worry about the</span> <span m=''2242000''>bounds
  for theta which will be zero to pi over two.</span> <span m=''2245000''>Or, you
  can also just plug in the bounds at the end.</span> <span m=''2250000''>So, now
  you have the two thirds times the integral from zero to</span> <span m=''2256000''>pi
  over two of cosine to the fourth theta d theta.</span> <span m=''2261000''>And,
  how do you integrate that? Well, you have to use double</span> <span m=''2268000''>angle
  formulas. OK, so cosine to the fourth,</span> <span m=''2275000''>remember, cosine
  squared theta is one plus cosine two theta</span> <span m=''2282000''>over two.
  And, we want the square of that.</span> <span m=''2294000''>And, so that will give
  us -- -- of,</span> <span m=''2303000''>well, we''ll have, it''s actually one quarter
  plus</span> <span m=''2309000''>one half cosine to theta plus one quarter cosine
  square to</span> <span m=''2317000''>theta d theta. And, how will you handle this</span>
  <span m=''2321000''>guy? Well, using,</span> <span m=''2322000''>again, the double
  angle formula.</span> <span m=''2325000''>OK, so it''s getting slightly nasty.</span>
  <span m=''2331000''>So, but I don''t know any simpler solution except for one</span>
  <span m=''2334000''>simpler solution, which is you have a table of</span> <span
  m=''2336000''>integrals of this form inside the notes.</span> <span m=''2339000''>Yes?
  No, I don''t think so because if</span> <span m=''2348000''>you take one half times
  cosine half times two,</span> <span m=''2352000''>you will still have half, OK?</span>
  <span m=''2355000''>So, if you do, again, the double angle</span> <span m=''2358000''>formula,
  I think I''m not going to bother to do it.</span> <span m=''2362000''>I claim you
  will get, at the end, pi over eight</span> <span m=''2377000''>because I say so.
  OK, so exercise,</span> <span m=''2386000''>continue calculating and get pi over
  eight.</span> <span m=''2394000''>OK, now what does the show us? Well, this shows
  us,</span> <span m=''2396000''>actually, that this is probably not the right way
  to do this.</span> <span m=''2400000''>OK, the right way to do this will be to integrate
  it in polar</span> <span m=''2402000''>coordinates. And, that''s what we will learn</span>
  <span m=''2405000''>how to do tomorrow. So, we will actually see how to</span> <span
  m=''2409000''>do it with much less trig.</span> <span m=''2436000''>So, that will
  be easier in polar coordinates.</span> <span m=''2446000''>So, we will see that
  tomorrow. OK, so we are almost there.</span> <span m=''2451000''>I mean, here you
  just use a double angle again and then you</span> <span m=''2453000''>can get it.
  And, it''s pretty</span> <span m=''2455000''>straightforward. OK, so one thing that''s
  kind of</span> <span m=''2460000''>interesting to know is we can exchange the order
  of</span> <span m=''2467000''>integration. Say we have an integral given</span>
  <span m=''2471000''>to us in the order dy dx, we can switch it to dx dy.</span>
  <span m=''2474000''>But, we have to be extremely careful with the bounds.</span>
  <span m=''2478000''>So, you certainly cannot just swap the bounds of the inner and</span>
  <span m=''2482000''>outer because there you would end up having this square root</span>
  <span m=''2486000''>of one minus x^2 on the outside, and you would never get a</span>
  <span m=''2490000''>number out of that. So, that cannot work.</span> <span m=''2493000''>It''s
  more complicated than that. OK, so, well,</span> <span m=''2497000''>here''s a first
  baby example. Certainly, if I do integral</span> <span m=''2502000''>from zero to
  one, integral from zero to two dx</span> <span m=''2506000''>dy, there, I can certainly
  switch the bounds without</span> <span m=''2511000''>thinking too much. What''s
  the reason for that?</span> <span m=''2514000''>Well, the reason for that is this
  corresponds in both cases</span> <span m=''2519000''>to integrating x from zero
  to two, and y from zero to one.</span> <span m=''2524000''>It''s a rectangle. So,
  if I slice it this way,</span> <span m=''2528000''>you see that y goes from zero
  to one for any x between zero</span> <span m=''2531000''>and two. It''s this guy.</span>
  <span m=''2533000''>If I slice it that way, then x goes from zero to two</span>
  <span m=''2538000''>for any value of y between zero and one.</span> <span m=''2542000''>And,
  it''s this one. So, here it works.</span> <span m=''2545000''>But in general, I
  have to draw picture of my</span> <span m=''2548000''>region, and see how the slices
  look like both ways.</span> <span m=''2552000''>OK, so let''s do a more interesting
  one.</span> <span m=''2561000''>Let''s say that I want to compute an integral from
  zero to</span> <span m=''2568000''>one of integral from x to square root of x of
  e^y over y dy dx.</span> <span m=''2575000''>So, why did I choose this guy? Which
  is the guy because as far</span> <span m=''2579000''>as I can tell, there''s no
  way to integrate e^y</span> <span m=''2583000''>over y. So, this is an integral
  that</span> <span m=''2586000''>you cannot compute this way. So, it''s a good example
  for why</span> <span m=''2590000''>this can be useful. So, if you do it this way,</span>
  <span m=''2593000''>you are stuck immediately. So, instead,</span> <span m=''2594000''>we
  will try to switch the order.</span> <span m=''2595000''>But, to switch the order,
  we have to understand,</span> <span m=''2600000''>what do these bounds mean? OK,
  so let''s draw a picture of</span> <span m=''2605000''>the region. Well what I am
  saying is y</span> <span m=''2609000''>equals x to y equals square root of x.</span>
  <span m=''2613000''>Well, let''s draw y equals x, and y equals square root of x.</span>
  <span m=''2628000''>Well, maybe I should actually put this here,</span> <span m=''2632000''>y
  equals x to y equals square root of x.</span> <span m=''2636000''>OK, and so I will
  go, for each value of x I will go</span> <span m=''2641000''>from y equals xo to
  y equals square root of x.</span> <span m=''2647000''>And then, we''ll do that for
  values of x that go from x</span> <span m=''2651000''>equals zero to x equals one,
  which happens to be exactly</span> <span m=''2655000''>where these things intersect.
  So, my region will consist of</span> <span m=''2662000''>all this, OK? So now, if
  I want to do it the</span> <span m=''2666000''>other way around, I have to decompose
  my region.</span> <span m=''2669000''>The other way around, I have to, so my goal,</span>
  <span m=''2672000''>now, is to rewrite this as an integral.</span> <span m=''2675000''>Well,
  it''s still the same function.</span> <span m=''2676000''>It''s still e to the y
  over y. But now, I want to integrate dx</span> <span m=''2681000''>dy. So, how do
  I integrate over x?</span> <span m=''2685000''>Well, I fix a value of y. And, for
  that value of y,</span> <span m=''2690000''>what''s the range of x? Well, the range
  for x is from</span> <span m=''2694000''>here to here. OK, what''s the value of
  x here?</span> <span m=''2697000''>Let''s start with an easy one. This is x equals
  y.</span> <span m=''2702000''>What about this one? It''s x equals y^2.</span> <span
  m=''2708000''>OK, so, x goes from y2 to y, and then what about y?</span> <span m=''2716000''>Well,
  I have to start at the bottom of my region.</span> <span m=''2719000''>That''s y
  equals zero to the top, which is at y equals one.</span> <span m=''2724000''>So,
  y goes from zero to one. So, switching the bounds is not</span> <span m=''2731000''>completely
  obvious. That took a little bit of work.</span> <span m=''2736000''>But now that
  we''ve done that, well,</span> <span m=''2740000''>just to see how it goes, it''s
  actually going to be much</span> <span m=''2744000''>easier to integrate because
  the inner integral,</span> <span m=''2748000''>well, what''s the integral of e^y
  over y with respect to x?</span> <span m=''2752000''>It''s just that times x, right,
  from x equals y^2 to y.</span> <span m=''2761000''>So, that will be, well, if I
  plug x equals y,</span> <span m=''2764000''>I will get e to the y minus, if I plug
  x equals y^2,</span> <span m=''2769000''>I will get e to the y over y times y^2
  into the y times y,</span> <span m=''2776000''>OK? So, now, if I do the outer</span>
  <span m=''2780000''>integral, I will have the integral from zero to one of e</span>
  <span m=''2787000''>to the y minus y^e to the y dy. And, that one actually is a</span>
  <span m=''2793000''>little bit easier. So, we know how to integrate</span> <span
  m=''2797000''>e^y. We don''t quite know how to</span> <span m=''2799000''>integrate
  ye^y. But, let''s try.</span> <span m=''2803000''>So, let''s see, what''s the derivative
  of ye^y?</span> <span m=''2809000''>Well, there''s a product rule that''s one times
  e^y plus y</span> <span m=''2815000''>times the derivative of e^y is ye^y.</span>
  <span m=''2819000''>So, if we do, OK, let''s put a minus sign in</span> <span m=''2823000''>front.
  Well, that''s almost what we</span> <span m=''2826000''>want, except we have a minus
  e^y instead of a plus e^y.</span> <span m=''2829000''>So, we need to add 2e^y. And,
  I claim that''s the</span> <span m=''2835000''>antiderivative. OK, if you got lost,</span>
  <span m=''2838000''>you can also integrate by integrating by parts,</span> <span
  m=''2841000''>by taking the derivative of y and integrating these guys.</span> <span
  m=''2845000''>Or, but, you know, that works. Just, your first guess would</span>
  <span m=''2849000''>be, maybe, let''s try minus y^e to the y.</span> <span m=''2852000''>Take
  the derivative of that, compare, see what you need to</span> <span m=''2855000''>do
  to fix. And so, if you take that</span> <span m=''2859000''>between zero and one,
  you''ll actually get e minus</span> <span m=''2865000''>two. OK,</span> <span m=''2867000''>so,
  tomorrow we are going to see</span> <span m=''2870000''>how to do double integrals
  in polar coordinates,</span> <span m=''2873000''>and also applications of double
  integrals,</span> <span m=''2875000''>how to use them for interesting things.</span>
