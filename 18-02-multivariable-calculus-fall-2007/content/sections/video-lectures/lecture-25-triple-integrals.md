  at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m=''23000''>All right, so the past few weeks, we''ve
  been looking at double integrals and the plane,</span> <span m=''27000''>line integrals
  in the plane, and will we are going to do now</span> <span m=''31000''>from now
  on basically until the end of the term,</span> <span m=''34000''>will be very similar
  stuff, but in space.</span> <span m=''36000''>So, we are going to learn how to do
  triple integrals in space,</span> <span m=''41000''>flux in space, work in space,</span>
  <span m=''43000''>divergence, curl, all that.</span> <span m=''46000''>So, that
  means, basically,</span> <span m=''49000''>if you were really on top of what we''ve
  been doing these past</span> <span m=''52000''>few weeks, then it will be just the
  same</span> <span m=''55000''>with one more coordinate. And, you will see there
  are</span> <span m=''58000''>some differences. But, conceptually,</span> <span m=''60000''>it''s
  pretty similar. There are a few tricky things,</span> <span m=''64000''>though.
  Now, that also means that if</span> <span m=''66000''>there is stuff that you are
  not sure about in the plane,</span> <span m=''70000''>then I encourage you to review
  the material that we''ve done</span> <span m=''74000''>over the past few weeks to
  make sure that everything in the</span> <span m=''78000''>plane is completely clear
  to you because it will be much harder</span> <span m=''82000''>to understand stuff
  in space if things are still shaky in the</span> <span m=''86000''>plane. OK, so
  the plan is we''re going</span> <span m=''90000''>to basically go through the same
  stuff, but in space.</span> <span m=''96000''>So, it shouldn''t be surprising that
  we will start today with</span> <span m=''105000''>triple integrals. OK, so the
  way triple integrals</span> <span m=''112000''>work is if I give you a function
  of three variables,</span> <span m=''118000''>x, y, z, and I give you some region
  in</span> <span m=''122000''>space, so, some solid,</span> <span m=''127000''>then
  I can take the integral over this region over function f</span> <span m=''135000''>dV
  where dV stands for the volume element.</span> <span m=''140000''>OK, so what it
  means is we will just take every single little</span> <span m=''144000''>piece of
  our solid, take the value of f there,</span> <span m=''148000''>multiply by the
  small volume of each little piece,</span> <span m=''150000''>and sum all these things
  together.</span> <span m=''155000''>And, so this volume element here,</span> <span
  m=''160000''>well, for example, if you are doing the integral</span> <span m=''164000''>in
  rectangular coordinates, that will become dx dy dz or</span> <span m=''168000''>any
  permutation of that because, of course, we have lots of</span> <span m=''174000''>possible
  orders of integration to choose from.</span> <span m=''179000''>So, rather than
  bore you with theory and all sorts of</span> <span m=''188000''>complicated things,
  let''s just do examples.</span> <span m=''195000''>And, you will see, basically,
  if you understand how to set up</span> <span m=''198000''>iterated integrals into
  variables,</span> <span m=''201000''>that you basically understand how to do them
  in three</span> <span m=''203000''>variables. You just have to be a bit more</span>
  <span m=''207000''>careful. And, there''s one more step.</span> <span m=''210000''>OK,
  so let''s take our first triple integral to be on the</span> <span m=''215000''>region.
  So, of course,</span> <span m=''216000''>there''s two different things as always.</span>
  <span m=''217000''>There is the region of integration and there''s the</span> <span
  m=''219000''>function we are integrating. Now, the function we are</span> <span
  m=''222000''>integrating, well, it will come in handy when you</span> <span m=''224000''>actually
  try to evaluate the integral.</span> <span m=''226000''>But, as you can see, probably,
  the new part is</span> <span m=''229000''>really hard to set it up. So, the function
  won''t really</span> <span m=''232000''>matter that much for me. So, in the examples
  I''ll do</span> <span m=''235000''>today, functions will be kind of silly.</span>
  <span m=''238000''>So, for example, let''s say that we want to look</span> <span
  m=''244000''>at the region between two paraboloids, one given by z = x</span> <span
  m=''253000''>^2 y ^2. The other is z = 4 - x ^2 - y</span> <span m=''260000''>^2.
  And, so, I haven''t given you,</span> <span m=''262000''>yet, the function to integrate.
  OK, this is not the function to</span> <span m=''266000''>integrate. This is what
  describes the</span> <span m=''268000''>region where I will integrate my function.</span>
  <span m=''272000''>And, let''s say that I just want to find the volume of this</span>
  <span m=''278000''>region, which is the triple integral of just one dV.</span> <span
  m=''283000''>OK, similarly, remember, when we try to find</span> <span m=''286000''>the
  area of the region in the plane, we are just integrating</span> <span m=''289000''>one
  dA. Here we integrate one dV.</span> <span m=''291000''>that will give us the volume.
  Now, I know that you can</span> <span m=''295000''>imagine how to actually do this
  one as a double integral.</span> <span m=''299000''>But, the goal of the game is
  to set up the triple integral.</span> <span m=''302000''>It''s not actually to find
  the volume.</span> <span m=''305000''>So, what does that look like? Well, z = x
  ^2 y ^2,</span> <span m=''312000''>that''s one of our favorite paraboloids.</span>
  <span m=''316000''>That''s something that looks like a parabola with its bottom</span>
  <span m=''322000''>at the origin that you spin about the z axis.</span> <span m=''328000''>And,
  z equals four minus x squared minus y squared,</span> <span m=''332000''>well, that''s
  also a paraboloid. But, this one is pointing down,</span> <span m=''336000''>and
  when you take x equals y equals zero, you get z equals</span> <span m=''340000''>four.
  So, it starts at four,</span> <span m=''344000''>and it goes down like that. OK,
  so the solid that we''d like</span> <span m=''352000''>to consider is what''s in
  between in here.</span> <span m=''356000''>So, it has a curvy top which is this
  downward paraboloid,</span> <span m=''360000''>a curvy bottom which is the other
  paraboloid.</span> <span m=''364000''>And, what about the sides? Well, do you have
  any idea what</span> <span m=''368000''>we get here? Yeah, it''s going to be a circle</span>
  <span m=''371000''>because entire picture is invariant by rotation about the</span>
  <span m=''375000''>z axis. So, if you look at the picture</span> <span m=''377000''>just,
  say, in the yz plane, you get this point and that</span> <span m=''380000''>point.
  And, when you rotate everything</span> <span m=''384000''>around the z axis, you
  will just get a circle</span> <span m=''390000''>here. OK, so our goal is to find
  the</span> <span m=''393000''>volume of this thing, and there''s lots of things
  I</span> <span m=''396000''>could do to simplify the calculation,</span> <span m=''398000''>or
  even not do it as a triple integral at all.</span> <span m=''401000''>But, I want
  to actually set it up as a triple integral just to</span> <span m=''406000''>show
  how we do that. OK, so the first thing we need</span> <span m=''410000''>to do is
  choose an order of integration.</span> <span m=''414000''>And, here, well, I don''t
  know if you can see it</span> <span m=''416000''>yet, but hopefully soon that will
  be intuitive to you.</span> <span m=''420000''>I claim that I would like to start
  by integrating first over</span> <span m=''424000''>z. What''s the reason for that?</span>
  <span m=''425000''>Well, the reason is if I give you x and y, then you can find</span>
  <span m=''429000''>quickly, what''s the bottom and top values of z for that choice</span>
  <span m=''433000''>of x and y? OK, so if I have x and y given,</span> <span m=''438000''>then
  I can find above that: what is the bottom z and the</span> <span m=''445000''>top
  z corresponding to the vertical line above that point?</span> <span m=''453000''>The
  portion of it that''s inside our solid, so somehow,</span> <span m=''459000''>there''s
  a bottom z and a top z. And, so the top z is actually</span> <span m=''465000''>on
  the downward paraboloid. So, it''s four minus x squared</span> <span m=''469000''>minus
  y squared. The bottom value of z is x</span> <span m=''472000''>squared plus y squared.
  OK, so if I want to start to</span> <span m=''478000''>set this up, I will write
  the triple integral.</span> <span m=''484000''>And then, so let''s say I''m going
  to do it dz first,</span> <span m=''489000''>and then, say, dy dx.</span> <span
  m=''491000''>It doesn''t really matter. So then, for a given value of x</span> <span
  m=''496000''>and y, I claim z goes from the bottom surface.</span> <span m=''499000''>The
  bottom face is z equals x squared plus y squared.</span> <span m=''503000''>The
  top face is four minus x squared minus y squared.</span> <span m=''509000''>OK,
  is that OK with everyone? Yeah?</span> <span m=''515000''>Any questions so far?
  Yes?</span> <span m=''523000''>Why did I start with z? That''s a very good question.</span>
  <span m=''525000''>So, I can choose whatever order I want, but let''s say I did
  x</span> <span m=''529000''>first . Then, to find the inner</span> <span m=''530000''>integral
  bounds, I would need to say, OK,</span> <span m=''533000''>I''ve chosen values of,
  see, in the inner integral,</span> <span m=''536000''>you''ve fixed the two other
  variables,</span> <span m=''539000''>and you''re just going to vary that one.</span>
  <span m=''541000''>And, you need to find bounds for it.</span> <span m=''542000''>So,
  if I integrate over x first, I have to solve,</span> <span m=''545000''>answer the
  following question. Say I''m given values of y and z.</span> <span m=''550000''>What
  are the bounds for x? So, that would mean I''m slicing</span> <span m=''554000''>my
  solid by lines that are parallel to the x axis.</span> <span m=''558000''>And, see,
  it''s kind of hard to find, what are the values of x</span> <span m=''561000''>at
  the front and at the back? I mean, it''s possible,</span> <span m=''564000''>but
  it''s easier to actually first look for z at the top and</span> <span m=''567000''>bottom.
  Yes?</span> <span m=''573000''>dy dx, or dx dy? No, it''s completely at random.</span>
  <span m=''576000''>I mean, you can see x and y play symmetric roles.</span> <span
  m=''579000''>So, if you look at it, it''s reasonably clear that z</span> <span m=''583000''>should
  be the easiest one to set up first for what comes next.</span> <span m=''589000''>xy
  or yx, it''s the same. Yes?</span> <span m=''594000''>Yes, it will be easier to
  use cylindrical coordinates.</span> <span m=''596000''>I''ll get to that just as
  soon as I''m done with this one.</span> <span m=''603000''>OK, so let''s continue
  a bit with that.</span> <span m=''607000''>And, as you mentioned, actually we don''t
  actually want</span> <span m=''611000''>to do it with xy in the end. In a few minutes,</span>
  <span m=''614000''>we will actually switch to cylindrical coordinates.</span> <span
  m=''616000''>But, for now, we don''t even know what they</span> <span m=''618000''>are.
  OK, so I''ve done the inner</span> <span m=''620000''>integral by looking at, you
  know, if I slice by</span> <span m=''625000''>vertical lines, what is the top?</span>
  <span m=''628000''>What is the bottom for a given value of x and y?</span> <span
  m=''631000''>So, the bounds in the inner integral depend on both the</span> <span
  m=''636000''>middle and outer variables. Next, I need to figure out what</span>
  <span m=''641000''>values of x and y I will be interested in.</span> <span m=''644000''>And,
  the answer for that is, well, the values of x and y</span> <span m=''647000''>that
  I want to look at are all those that are in the shade of</span> <span m=''651000''>my
  region. So, in fact,</span> <span m=''653000''>to set up the middle and outer bounds,
  what I want to do is</span> <span m=''657000''>project my solid. So, my solid looks
  like this</span> <span m=''664000''>kind of thing. And, I don''t really know how
  to</span> <span m=''669000''>call it. But, what''s interesting now is</span> <span
  m=''673000''>I want to look at the shadow that it casts in the xy plane.</span>
  <span m=''678000''>OK, and, of course, that shadow will just be the</span> <span
  m=''682000''>disk that''s directly below this disk here that''s separating the</span>
  <span m=''687000''>two halves of the solid. And so, now I will want to</span> <span
  m=''694000''>integrate over, I want to look at all the xy''s,</span> <span m=''701000''>x
  and y, in the shadow. So, now I''m left with,</span> <span m=''706000''>actually,
  something we''ve already done,</span> <span m=''708000''>namely setting up a double
  integral over x and y.</span> <span m=''712000''>So, if it helps, here, we don''t
  strictly need</span> <span m=''715000''>it, but if it helps, it could be useful
  to actually</span> <span m=''719000''>draw a picture of this shadow in the xy plane.</span>
  <span m=''723000''>So, here it would just look, again, like a disk,</span> <span
  m=''734000''>and set it up. Now, the question is,</span> <span m=''738000''>how
  do we find the size of this disk, the size of the shadow?</span> <span m=''742000''>Well,
  basically we have to figure out where our two</span> <span m=''748000''>paraboloids
  intersect. There''s nothing else.</span> <span m=''757000''>OK, so, one way how
  to find the shadow in the xy plane -- --</span> <span m=''769000''>well, here we
  actually know the</span> <span m=''773000''>answer a priori, but even if we didn''t,</span>
  <span m=''776000''>we could just say, well, our region lives wherever</span> <span
  m=''779000''>the bottom surface is below the top surface,</span> <span m=''783000''>OK,
  so we want to look at things wherever bottom value of</span> <span m=''791000''>z
  is less than the top value of z,</span> <span m=''795000''>I mean, less or less
  than or equal, that''s the same thing.</span> <span m=''798000''>So, if the bottom
  value of z is x squared plus y squared should</span> <span m=''804000''>be less
  than four minus x squared minus y squared,</span> <span m=''808000''>and if you
  solve for that, then you will get,</span> <span m=''813000''>well, so let''s move
  these guys over here.</span> <span m=''814000''>You''ll get two x squared plus two
  y squared less than four.</span> <span m=''817000''>That becomes x squared plus
  y squared less than two.</span> <span m=''822000''>So, that means that''s a disk
  of radius square root of two,</span> <span m=''832000''>OK? So, we kind of knew
  in advance</span> <span m=''836000''>it was going to be a disk, but what we''ve
  learned now is</span> <span m=''841000''>that this radius is square root of two.</span>
  <span m=''845000''>So, if we want to set up, if we really want to set it up</span>
  <span m=''848000''>using dy dx like they started, then we can do it because we</span>
  <span m=''853000''>know, so, for the middle integral,</span> <span m=''856000''>now,
  we want to fix a value of x.</span> <span m=''859000''>And, for that fixed value
  of x, we want to figure out the</span> <span m=''861000''>bounds for y. Well, the
  answer is y goes from</span> <span m=''865000''>here to here. What''s here?</span>
  <span m=''866000''>Well, here, y is square root of two minus x squared.</span> <span
  m=''871000''>And, here it''s negative square root of two minus x squared.</span>
  <span m=''876000''>So, y will go from negative square root of two minus x</span>
  <span m=''880000''>squared to positive square root. And then, x will go from</span>
  <span m=''886000''>negative root two to root two. OK, if that''s not completely</span>
  <span m=''892000''>clear to you, then I encourage you to go over</span> <span m=''895000''>how
  we set up double integrals again.</span> <span m=''898000''>OK, does that make sense,
  kind of?</span> <span m=''902000''>Yeah? Well, so, when we set up,</span> <span
  m=''917000''>remember, we are setting up a double integral,</span> <span m=''920000''>dy
  dx here. So, when we do it dy dx,</span> <span m=''923000''>it means we slice this
  region of a plane by vertical line</span> <span m=''927000''>segments. So, this
  middle guy would be</span> <span m=''930000''>what used to be the inner integral.</span>
  <span m=''933000''>So, in the inner, remember, you fix the value of</span> <span
  m=''936000''>x, and you ask yourself, what is the range of values of</span> <span
  m=''939000''>y in my region? So, y goes from here to here,</span> <span m=''943000''>and
  what here and here are depends on the value of x.</span> <span m=''946000''>How?
  Well, we have to find the</span> <span m=''948000''>relation between x and y at
  these points.</span> <span m=''950000''>These points are on the circle of radius
  root two.</span> <span m=''953000''>So, if you want this circle maybe I should have
  written,</span> <span m=''956000''>is x squared plus y squared equals two.</span>
  <span m=''958000''>And, if you solve for y, given x, you get plus minus</span> <span
  m=''963000''>root of two minus x squared, OK?</span> <span m=''967000''>Yes? Is
  there a way to compute this</span> <span m=''971000''>with symmetry? Well, certainly,</span>
  <span m=''973000''>yeah, this solid looks sufficiently symmetric,</span> <span m=''975000''>but
  actually you could certainly,</span> <span m=''977000''>if you don''t want to do
  the whole disk,</span> <span m=''979000''>you could just do quarter disks,</span>
  <span m=''981000''>and multiply by four. You could even just look at the</span>
  <span m=''985000''>lower half of the solid, and multiply them by two,</span> <span
  m=''989000''>so, total by eight. So, yeah, certainly there''s</span> <span m=''993000''>lots
  of ways to make it slightly easier by using symmetry.</span> <span m=''996000''>Now,
  the most spectacular way to use symmetry here,</span> <span m=''999000''>of course,
  is to use that we have this rotation symmetry and</span> <span m=''1001000''>switch,
  actually, not do this guy in xy</span> <span m=''1005000''>coordinates but instead
  in polar coordinates.</span> <span m=''1010000''>So -- So, the smarter thing to
  do would be to use polar</span> <span m=''1028000''>coordinates instead of x and
  y. Of course, we want to keep z.</span> <span m=''1041000''>I mean, we are very
  happy with z the way it is.</span> <span m=''1043000''>But, we''ll just change x
  and y to R cos theta,</span> <span m=''1048000''>R sine theta, OK, because,</span>
  <span m=''1051000''>well, let''s see actually how we would evaluate this guy.</span>
  <span m=''1057000''>So, well actually, let''s not. It''s kind of boring.</span>
  <span m=''1066000''>So, let me just point out one small thing here,</span> <span
  m=''1070000''>sorry, before I do that. So, if you start computing the</span> <span
  m=''1074000''>inner integral, OK, so let me not do that yet,</span> <span m=''1079000''>sorry,
  so if you try to compute the</span> <span m=''1083000''>inner integral, you''ll
  be integrating from x</span> <span m=''1086000''>squared plus y squared to four
  minus x squared minus y squared</span> <span m=''1091000''>dz. Well, that will integrate
  to z</span> <span m=''1095000''>between these two bounds. So, you will get four
  minus two</span> <span m=''1102000''>x squared minus two y squared. Now, when you
  put that into the</span> <span m=''1107000''>remaining ones, you''ll get something
  that''s</span> <span m=''1113000''>probably not very pleasant of four minus two
  x squared minus</span> <span m=''1121000''>two y squared dy dx. And here, you see
  that to</span> <span m=''1129000''>evaluate this, you would switch to polar</span>
  <span m=''1136000''>coordinates. Oh, by the way,</span> <span m=''1139000''>so if
  your initial instincts had been to,</span> <span m=''1144000''>given that you just
  want the volume,</span> <span m=''1146000''>you could also have found the volume
  just by doing a double</span> <span m=''1149000''>integral of the height between
  the top and bottom.</span> <span m=''1152000''>Well, you would just have gotten
  this, right,</span> <span m=''1154000''>because this is the height between top and
  bottom.</span> <span m=''1157000''>So, it''s all the same. It doesn''t really matter.</span>
  <span m=''1161000''>But with this, of course, we will be able to</span> <span m=''1163000''>integrate
  all sorts of functions, not just one over the</span> <span m=''1166000''>solid.
  So, we will be able to do much</span> <span m=''1171000''>more than just volumes.
  OK, so let''s see,</span> <span m=''1175000''>how do we do it with polar coordinates
  instead?</span> <span m=''1177000''>Well, so -- Well, that would become,</span>
  <span m=''1193000''>so let''s see. So, I want to keep dz.</span> <span m=''1202000''>But
  then, dx dy or dy dx would become r dr d theta.</span> <span m=''1210000''>And,
  if I try to set up the bounds, well,</span> <span m=''1213000''>I probably shouldn''t
  keep this x squared plus y squared around.</span> <span m=''1217000''>But, x squared
  plus y squared is easy in terms of r and theta.</span> <span m=''1220000''>That''s
  just r squared. OK, I mean, in general I could</span> <span m=''1226000''>have something
  that depends also on theta.</span> <span m=''1228000''>That''s perfectly legitimate.
  But here, it simplifies,</span> <span m=''1232000''>and this guy up here, four minus
  x squared minus y</span> <span m=''1236000''>squared becomes four minus r squared.</span>
  <span m=''1240000''>And now, the integral that we have to do over r and theta,</span>
  <span m=''1243000''>well, we look again at the shadow.</span> <span m=''1245000''>The
  shadow is still a disk of radius root two.</span> <span m=''1248000''>That hasn''t
  changed. And now, we know how to set up</span> <span m=''1252000''>this integral
  in polar coordinates.</span> <span m=''1254000''>r goes from zero to root two, and
  theta goes from zero to two</span> <span m=''1261000''>pi. OK, and now it becomes
  actually</span> <span m=''1271000''>easier to evaluate. OK, so now we have actually
  a</span> <span m=''1280000''>name for this because we''re doing it in space.</span>
  <span m=''1284000''>So, these are called, actually, cylindrical</span> <span m=''1288000''>coordinates.
  So, in fact,</span> <span m=''1290000''>you already knew about cylindrical coordinates
  even if</span> <span m=''1295000''>you did not know the name. OK, so the idea of
  cylindrical</span> <span m=''1300000''>coordinates is that instead of x, y, and
  z, to locate a point</span> <span m=''1305000''>in space, you will use three coordinates.</span>
  <span m=''1308000''>One of them is basically how high it is above the xy plane.</span>
  <span m=''1320000''>So, that will be z. And then, you will use polar</span> <span
  m=''1324000''>coordinates for the projection of your point on the xy plane.</span>
  <span m=''1328000''>So, r will be the distance from the z axis.</span> <span m=''1332000''>And
  theta will be the angle from the x axis</span> <span m=''1337000''>counterclockwise.
  So, the one thing to be careful</span> <span m=''1341000''>about is because of the
  usual convention, that we make the x</span> <span m=''1344000''>axis point toward
  us. Theta equals zero is no longer</span> <span m=''1347000''>to the right. Now,
  theta equals zero is to</span> <span m=''1350000''>the front, and the angel is measured
  from the front</span> <span m=''1354000''>counterclockwise. OK, so,</span> <span
  m=''1359000''>and of course, if you want to know how to</span> <span m=''1361000''>convert
  between x, y, z and r theta z,</span> <span m=''1364000''>well, the formulas are
  just the same as in usual polar</span> <span m=''1369000''>coordinates. R cos theta,</span>
  <span m=''1372000''>r sine theta, and z remain z.</span> <span m=''1376000''>OK,
  so why are these called cylindrical coordinates,</span> <span m=''1379000''>by the
  way? Well, let''s say that I gave you</span> <span m=''1382000''>the equation r
  equals a, where a is some constant.</span> <span m=''1387000''>Say r equals one,
  for example. So, r equals one in 2D,</span> <span m=''1392000''>that used to be
  just a circle of radius one.</span> <span m=''1395000''>Now, in space, a single
  equation actually</span> <span m=''1399000''>defines a surface, not just a curve
  anymore.</span> <span m=''1403000''>And, the set of points where r is a, well, that''s
  all the</span> <span m=''1406000''>points that are distance a from the z axis.</span>
  <span m=''1409000''>So, in fact, what you get this way is a</span> <span m=''1414000''>cylinder
  of radius a centered on the z axis.</span> <span m=''1421000''>OK, so that''s why
  they are called cylindrical coordinates.</span> <span m=''1428000''>By the way,
  so now, similarly, if you look at the</span> <span m=''1431000''>equation theta
  equals some given value, well, so that used to be</span> <span m=''1435000''>just
  a ray from the origin. Now, that becomes a vertical</span> <span m=''1439000''>half
  plane. For example,</span> <span m=''1441000''>if I set the value of theta and let
  r and z vary,</span> <span m=''1444000''>well, r is always positive, but basically
  that means I am</span> <span m=''1448000''>taking a vertical plane that comes out
  in this direction.</span> <span m=''1453000''>OK, any questions about cylindrical
  coordinates?</span> <span m=''1458000''>Yes? Yeah, so I''m saying when you</span>
  <span m=''1467000''>fix theta, you get only a half plane, not a full plane.</span>
  <span m=''1470000''>I mean, it goes all the way up and down, but it doesn''t go
  back</span> <span m=''1473000''>to the other side of the z axis. Why?</span> <span
  m=''1475000''>That''s because r is always positive by convention.</span> <span m=''1479000''>So,
  for example, here, we say theta is zero.</span> <span m=''1481000''>At the back,
  we say theta is pi. We don''t say theta is zero and</span> <span m=''1484000''>r
  is negative. We say r is positive and theta</span> <span m=''1487000''>is pi. It''s
  a convention, largely.</span> <span m=''1490000''>But, sticking with this convention
  really will help you</span> <span m=''1492000''>to set up the integrals properly.</span>
  <span m=''1494000''>I mean, otherwise there is just too much risk for mistakes.</span>
  <span m=''1498000''>Yes? Well, so the question is if I</span> <span m=''1508000''>were
  to use symmetry to do this one, would I multiply by four or</span> <span m=''1511000''>by
  two? Well, it depends on how much</span> <span m=''1513000''>symmetry you are using.
  So, I mean, it''s your choice.</span> <span m=''1516000''>You can multiply by two,
  by four, by eight depending on</span> <span m=''1519000''>how much you cut it. So,
  it depends on what symmetry</span> <span m=''1522000''>you use, if you use symmetry
  between top and bottom you''d</span> <span m=''1524000''>say, well, the volume is
  twice the lower half.</span> <span m=''1527000''>If you use the left and right half,
  you would say it''s twice</span> <span m=''1530000''>each half. If you cut it into
  four pieces,</span> <span m=''1534000''>and so on. So, and again,</span> <span m=''1537000''>you
  don''t have to use the symmetry.</span> <span m=''1541000''>If you don''t think
  of using polar coordinates,</span> <span m=''1544000''>then it can save you from
  doing,</span> <span m=''1546000''>you know, you can just start at zero here and
  here,</span> <span m=''1547000''>and simplify things a tiny bit. But, OK, yes?</span>
  <span m=''1561000''>So, to define a vertical full plane, well, first of all it</span>
  <span m=''1564000''>depends on whether it passes through the z axis or not.</span>
  <span m=''1567000''>If it doesn''t, then you''d have to remember how</span> <span
  m=''1569000''>you do in polar coordinates. I mean, basically the answer</span> <span
  m=''1573000''>is, if you have a vertical plane, so, it doesn''t depend on</span>
  <span m=''1576000''>z. The equation does not involve z.</span> <span m=''1578000''>It
  only involves r and theta. And, how it involves r and</span> <span m=''1581000''>theta
  is exactly the same as when you do a line in polar</span> <span m=''1584000''>coordinates
  in the plane. So, if it''s a line passing</span> <span m=''1587000''>through the
  origin, you say, well,</span> <span m=''1589000''>theta is either some value or
  the other one.</span> <span m=''1592000''>If it''s a line that doesn''t passes to
  the origin,</span> <span m=''1593000''>but it''s more tricky. But hopefully you''ve
  seen how</span> <span m=''1598000''>to do that. OK, let''s move on a bit.</span>
  <span m=''1609000''>So, one thing to know, I mean, basically,</span> <span m=''1613000''>the
  important thing to remember is that the volume element in</span> <span m=''1617000''>cylindrical
  coordinates, well, dx dy dz becomes r dr d</span> <span m=''1625000''>theta dz.
  And, that shouldn''t be</span> <span m=''1628000''>surprising because that''s just
  dx dy becomes r dr d theta.</span> <span m=''1632000''>And, dz remains dz. I mean,
  so, the way to think</span> <span m=''1638000''>about it, if you want,</span> <span
  m=''1639000''>is that if you take a little piece of solid in space,</span> <span
  m=''1645000''>so it has some height, delta z, and it has a base which has</span>
  <span m=''1651000''>some area delta A, then the small volume, delta v,</span> <span
  m=''1656000''>is equal to the area of a base times the height.</span> <span m=''1661000''>So,
  now, when you make the things infinitely small,</span> <span m=''1663000''>you will
  get dV is dA times dz, and you can use whichever</span> <span m=''1671000''>formula
  you want for area in the xy plane.</span> <span m=''1676000''>OK, now in practice,
  you choose which order you</span> <span m=''1680000''>integrate in. As you have
  probably seen,</span> <span m=''1683000''>a favorite of mine is z first because
  very often you''ll know</span> <span m=''1687000''>what the top and bottom of your
  solid look like,</span> <span m=''1690000''>and then you will reduce to just something
  in the xy plane.</span> <span m=''1693000''>But, there might be situations where
  it''s actually easier to</span> <span m=''1698000''>start first with dx dy or r
  dr d theta, and then save dz for</span> <span m=''1702000''>last. I mean, if you
  seen how to,</span> <span m=''1704000''>in single variable calculus, the disk and
  shell methods for</span> <span m=''1707000''>finding volumes, that''s exactly the
  dilemma of</span> <span m=''1710000''>shells versus disks. One of them is you do
  z first.</span> <span m=''1719000''>The other is you do z last. OK, so what are
  things we can</span> <span m=''1729000''>do now with triple integrals? Well, we
  can find the volume of</span> <span m=''1736000''>solids by just integrating dV.
  And, we''ve seen that.</span> <span m=''1740000''>We can find the mass of a solid.
  OK, so if we have a density,</span> <span m=''1746000''>delta, which, remember,
  delta is basically</span> <span m=''1750000''>the mass divided by the volume. OK,
  so the small mass element,</span> <span m=''1757000''>maybe I should have written
  that as dm, the mass element,</span> <span m=''1763000''>is density times dV. So
  now, this is the real</span> <span m=''1767000''>physical density. If you are given
  a material,</span> <span m=''1769000''>usually, the density will be in grams per
  cubic meter or cubic</span> <span m=''1773000''>inch, or whatever. I mean, there
  is tons of</span> <span m=''1775000''>different units. But, so then,</span> <span
  m=''1777000''>the mass of your solid will be just the triple integral of</span>
  <span m=''1783000''>density, dV because you just sum the mass of each little piece.</span>
  <span m=''1790000''>And, of course, if the density is one,</span> <span m=''1793000''>then
  it just becomes the volume.</span> <span m=''1795000''>OK, now, it shouldn''t be
  surprising</span> <span m=''1799000''>to you that we can also do classics that we
  had seen in the</span> <span m=''1802000''>plane such as the average value of a
  function,</span> <span m=''1805000''>the center of mass, and moment of inertia.</span>
  <span m=''1838000''>OK, so the average value of the function f of x,</span> <span
  m=''1847000''>y, z in the region, r,</span> <span m=''1851000''>that would be f
  bar, would be one over the volume of</span> <span m=''1857000''>the region times
  the triple integral of f dV.</span> <span m=''1862000''>Or, if we have a density,
  and we want to take a weighted</span> <span m=''1869000''>average -- Then we take
  one over the mass where the mass is the</span> <span m=''1881000''>triple integral
  of the density times the triple integral of f</span> <span m=''1892000''>density
  dV. So, as particular cases,</span> <span m=''1896000''>there is, again, the notion
  of center of mass of</span> <span m=''1899000''>the solid. So, that''s the point
  that</span> <span m=''1901000''>somehow right in the middle of the solid.</span>
  <span m=''1904000''>That''s the point mass by which there is a point at which you</span>
  <span m=''1908000''>should put point mass so that it would be equivalent from the</span>
  <span m=''1913000''>point of view of dealing with forces and translation effects,</span>
  <span m=''1917000''>of course, not for rotation. But, so the center of mass of a</span>
  <span m=''1923000''>solid is just given by taking the average values of x,</span>
  <span m=''1929000''>y, and z. OK, so there is a special case</span> <span m=''1934000''>where,
  so, x bar is one over the mass times triple integral of x</span> <span m=''1941000''>density
  dV. And, same thing with y and z.</span> <span m=''1951000''>And, of course, very
  often, you can use</span> <span m=''1953000''>symmetry to not have to compute all
  three of them.</span> <span m=''1957000''>For example, if you look at this solid
  that</span> <span m=''1959000''>we had, well, I guess I''ve erased it now.</span>
  <span m=''1961000''>But, if you remember what it looked, well,</span> <span m=''1963000''>it
  was pretty obvious that the center of mass would be in the z</span> <span m=''1965000''>axis.
  So, no need to waste time</span> <span m=''1967000''>considering x bar and y bar.</span>
  <span m=''1983000''>And, in fact, you can also find z bar by</span> <span m=''1988000''>symmetry
  between the top and bottom, and let you figure that</span> <span m=''1996000''>out.
  Of course, symmetry only works,</span> <span m=''1998000''>I should say, symmetry
  only works if the</span> <span m=''2000000''>density is also symmetric. If I had
  taken my guy to be</span> <span m=''2005000''>heavier at the front than at the back,
  then it would no longer be</span> <span m=''2011000''>true that x bar would be zero.
  OK, next on the list is moment</span> <span m=''2017000''>of inertia. Actually,
  in a way,</span> <span m=''2020000''>moment of inertia in 3D is easier conceptually
  than in 2D.</span> <span m=''2025000''>So, why is that? Well, because now the various</span>
  <span m=''2029000''>flavors that we had come together in a nice way.</span> <span
  m=''2033000''>So, the moment of inertia of an axis,</span> <span m=''2036000''>sorry,
  with respect to an axis would be,</span> <span m=''2038000''>again, given by the
  triple integral of the distance to the</span> <span m=''2046000''>axis squared times
  density, times dV.</span> <span m=''2051000''>And, in particular, we have our solid.</span>
  <span m=''2055000''>And, we might skewer it using any of the coordinate axes and</span>
  <span m=''2059000''>then try to rotate it about one of the axes.</span> <span m=''2062000''>So,
  we have three different possibilities,</span> <span m=''2064000''>of course, the
  x, y, or z axis.</span> <span m=''2067000''>And, so now, rotating about the z axis</span>
  <span m=''2069000''>actually corresponds to when we were just doing things for flat</span>
  <span m=''2074000''>objects in the xy plane. That corresponded to rotating</span>
  <span m=''2078000''>about the origin. So, secretly,</span> <span m=''2080000''>we
  were saying we were rotating about the point.</span> <span m=''2082000''>But actually,
  it was just rotating about the</span> <span m=''2084000''>z axis. Just I didn''t
  want to introduce</span> <span m=''2087000''>the z coordinate that we didn''t actually
  need at the time.</span> <span m=''2118000''>So -- [APPLAUSE] OK, so moment of inertia
  about</span> <span m=''2123000''>the z axis, so, what''s the distance to the z</span>
  <span m=''2128000''>axis? Well, we''ve said that''s exactly</span> <span m=''2131000''>r.
  That''s the cylindrical</span> <span m=''2134000''>coordinate, r. So, the square
  of a distance is</span> <span m=''2139000''>just r squared. Now, if you didn''t
  want to do</span> <span m=''2144000''>it in cylindrical coordinates then, of course,</span>
  <span m=''2149000''>r squared is just x squared plus y squared.</span> <span m=''2155000''>Square
  of distance from the z axis is just x squared plus y</span> <span m=''2158000''>squared.
  Similarly, now,</span> <span m=''2160000''>if you want the distance from the x axis,
  well,</span> <span m=''2164000''>that will be y squared plus z squared.</span> <span
  m=''2167000''>OK, try to convince yourselves of the picture,</span> <span m=''2169000''>or
  else just argue by symmetry: you know, if you change the</span> <span m=''2173000''>positions
  of the axis. So, moment of inertia about the</span> <span m=''2178000''>x axis is
  the double integral of y squared plus z squared delta</span> <span m=''2185000''>dV.
  And moment of inertia about the</span> <span m=''2189000''>y axis is the same thing,
  but now with x squared plus z</span> <span m=''2194000''>squared. And so, now,</span>
  <span m=''2196000''>if you try to apply these things for flat solids that are</span>
  <span m=''2199000''>in the xy plane, so where there''s no z to look</span> <span
  m=''2202000''>at, well, you see these formulas</span> <span m=''2205000''>become
  the old formulas that we had.</span> <span m=''2208000''>But now, they all fit together
  in a more symmetric way.</span> <span m=''2216000''>OK, any questions about that?
  No?</span> <span m=''2224000''>OK, so these are just formulas to remember.</span>
  <span m=''2228000''>So, OK, let''s do an example. Was there a question that I</span>
  <span m=''2241000''>missed? No?</span> <span m=''2244000''>OK, so let''s find the
  moment of inertia about the z axis of a</span> <span m=''2254000''>solid cone --
  -- between z equals a times r and z equals b.</span> <span m=''2264000''>So, just
  to convince you that it''s a cone, so,</span> <span m=''2267000''>z equals a times
  r means the height is proportional to the</span> <span m=''2272000''>distance from
  the z axis. So, let''s look at what we get</span> <span m=''2277000''>if we just
  do it in the plane of a blackboard.</span> <span m=''2280000''>So, if I go to the
  right here, r is just the distance from the</span> <span m=''2284000''>x axis. The
  height should be</span> <span m=''2286000''>proportional with proportionality factor
  A.</span> <span m=''2289000''>So, that means I take a line with slope A.</span>
  <span m=''2294000''>If I''m on the left, well, it''s the same story</span> <span
  m=''2296000''>except distance to the z axis is still positive.</span> <span m=''2299000''>So,
  I get the symmetric thing. And, in fact,</span> <span m=''2302000''>it doesn''t
  matter which vertical plane I do it in.</span> <span m=''2305000''>This is the same
  if I rotate about.</span> <span m=''2308000''>See, there''s no theta in here. So,
  it''s the same in all</span> <span m=''2312000''>directions. So, I claim it''s a
  cone where</span> <span m=''2316000''>the slope of the rays is A. OK, and z equals
  b.</span> <span m=''2323000''>Well, that just means we stop in our horizontal plane
  at</span> <span m=''2330000''>height b. OK, so that''s solid cone really</span>
  <span m=''2333000''>just looks like this. That''s our solid.</span> <span m=''2338000''>OK,
  so it has a flat top, that circular top,</span> <span m=''2342000''>and then the
  point is at v. The tip of it is at the origin.</span> <span m=''2348000''>So, let''s
  try to compute its moment of inertia about the z</span> <span m=''2352000''>axis.
  So, that means maybe this is</span> <span m=''2354000''>like the top that you are
  going to spin.</span> <span m=''2356000''>And, it tells you how hard it is to actually
  spin that top.</span> <span m=''2361000''>Actually, that''s also useful if you''re
  going to do mechanical</span> <span m=''2364000''>engineering because if you are
  trying to design gears,</span> <span m=''2367000''>and things like that that will
  rotate,</span> <span m=''2368000''>you might want to know exactly how much effort
  you''ll have to</span> <span m=''2371000''>put to actually get them to spin,</span>
  <span m=''2373000''>and whether you''re actually going to have a strong enough</span>
  <span m=''2377000''>engine, or whatever, to do it.</span> <span m=''2379000''>OK,
  so what''s the moment of inertia of this guy?</span> <span m=''2381000''>Well, that''s
  the triple integral of, well,</span> <span m=''2384000''>we have to choose x squared
  plus y squared or r squared.</span> <span m=''2389000''>Let''s see, I think I want
  to use cylindrical coordinates to</span> <span m=''2392000''>do that, given the
  shape. So, we use r squared.</span> <span m=''2397000''>I might have a density that
  let''s say the density is one.</span> <span m=''2402000''>So, I don''t have density.
  I still have dV.</span> <span m=''2406000''>Now, it will be my choice to choose
  between doing the dz</span> <span m=''2413000''>first or doing r dr d theta first.</span>
  <span m=''2417000''>Just to show you how it goes the other way around,</span> <span
  m=''2420000''>let me do it r dr d theta dz this time.</span> <span m=''2423000''>Then
  you can decide on a case-by-case basis which one you</span> <span m=''2429000''>like
  best. OK, so if we do it in this</span> <span m=''2433000''>direction, it means
  that in the inner and middle integrals,</span> <span m=''2436000''>we''ve fixed
  a value of z. And, for that particular value</span> <span m=''2440000''>of z, we''ll
  be actually slicing our solid by a horizontal plane,</span> <span m=''2445000''>and
  looking at what we get, OK?</span> <span m=''2447000''>So, what does that look like?
  Well, I fixed a value of z,</span> <span m=''2454000''>and I slice my solid by a
  horizontal plane.</span> <span m=''2459000''>Well, I''m going to get a circle certainly.</span>
  <span m=''2464000''>What''s the radius, well, a disk actually,</span> <span m=''2467000''>what''s
  the radius of the disk? Yeah, the radius of the disk</span> <span m=''2471000''>should
  be z over a because the equation of that cone,</span> <span m=''2474000''>we said
  it''s z equals ar. So, if you flip it around,</span> <span m=''2479000''>so, maybe
  I should switch to another blackboard.</span> <span m=''2484000''>So, the equation
  of a cone is z equals ar, or equivalently r</span> <span m=''2493000''>equals z
  over a. So, for a given value of z,</span> <span m=''2500000''>I will get, this
  guy will be a disk of radius z over a.</span> <span m=''2509000''>OK, so, moment
  of inertia is going to be, well,</span> <span m=''2515000''>we said r squared, r
  dr d theta dz.</span> <span m=''2519000''>Now, so, to set up the inner and middle
  integrals,</span> <span m=''2522000''>I just set up a double integral over this
  disk of radius z over</span> <span m=''2526000''>a. So, it''s easy.</span> <span
  m=''2527000''>r goes from zero to z over a. Theta goes from zero to 2pi.</span>
  <span m=''2534000''>OK, and then, well, if I set up the bounds</span> <span m=''2537000''>for
  z, now it''s my outer variable.</span> <span m=''2540000''>So, the question I have
  to ask is what is the first slice?</span> <span m=''2544000''>What is the last slice?
  So, the bottommost value of z</span> <span m=''2548000''>would be zero, and the
  topmost would be b.</span> <span m=''2553000''>And so, that''s it I get. So, exercise,</span>
  <span m=''2557000''>it''s not very hard. Try to set it up the other way</span> <span
  m=''2562000''>around with dz first and then r dr d theta.</span> <span m=''2567000''>It''s
  pretty much the same level of difficulty.</span> <span m=''2569000''>I''m sure you
  can do both of them.</span> <span m=''2572000''>So, and also, if you want to practice</span>
  <span m=''2577000''>calculations, you should end up getting pi b</span> <span m=''2583000''>to
  the five over 10a to the four if I got it right.</span> <span m=''2590000''>OK,
  let me finish with one more example.</span> <span m=''2594000''>I''m trying to give
  you plenty of practice because in case you</span> <span m=''2597000''>haven''t noticed,
  Monday is a holiday.</span> <span m=''2599000''>So, you don''t have recitation on
  Monday, which is good.</span> <span m=''2602000''>But it means that there will be
  lots of stuff to cover on</span> <span m=''2605000''>Wednesday. So -- Thank you.</span>
  <span m=''2627000''>OK, so third example, let''s say that I want to just</span>
  <span m=''2638000''>set up a triple integral for the region where z is bigger than</span>
  <span m=''2649000''>one minus y inside the unit ball centered at the origin.</span>
  <span m=''2658000''>So, the unit ball is just, you know, well,</span> <span m=''2664000''>stay
  inside of the unit sphere. So, its equation,</span> <span m=''2670000''>if you want,
  would be x squared plus y</span> <span m=''2673000''>squared plus z squared less
  than one.</span> <span m=''2675000''>OK, so that''s one thing you should remember.</span>
  <span m=''2677000''>The equation of a sphere centered at the origin is x</span>
  <span m=''2680000''>squared plus y squared plus z squared equals radius squared.</span>
  <span m=''2684000''>And now, we are going to take this plane, z equals one minus</span>
  <span m=''2688000''>y. So, if you think about it,</span> <span m=''2690000''>it''s
  parallel to the x axis because there''s no x in its</span> <span m=''2692000''>coordinate
  in its equation. At the origin,</span> <span m=''2695000''>the height is one. So,
  it starts right here at one.</span> <span m=''2699000''>And, it slopes down with
  y with slope one.</span> <span m=''2704000''>OK, so it''s a plane that comes straight
  out here,</span> <span m=''2707000''>and it intersects the sphere, so here and here,</span>
  <span m=''2710000''>but also at other points in between.</span> <span m=''2713000''>Any
  idea what kind of shape this is?</span> <span m=''2718000''>Well, it''s an ellipse,
  but it''s even more than that.</span> <span m=''2720000''>It''s also a circle. If
  you slice a sphere by a</span> <span m=''2723000''>plane, you always get a circle.
  But, of course,</span> <span m=''2725000''>it''s a slanted circle. So, if you look
  at it in the xy</span> <span m=''2728000''>plane, if you project it to the xy plane,
  that you will get an</span> <span m=''2731000''>ellipse. OK, so we want to look
  at this</span> <span m=''2735000''>guy in here. So, how do we do that?</span> <span
  m=''2738000''>Well, so maybe I should actually draw quickly a picture.</span> <span
  m=''2742000''>So, in the yz plane, it looks just like this,</span> <span m=''2747000''>OK?
  But, if I look at it from above</span> <span m=''2751000''>in the xy plane, then
  its shadow,</span> <span m=''2754000''>well, see, it will sit entirely where y is
  positive.</span> <span m=''2759000''>So, it sits entirely above here, and it goes
  through here</span> <span m=''2762000''>and here. And, in fact,</span> <span m=''2764000''>when
  you project that slanted circle, now you will get an</span> <span m=''2768000''>ellipse.
  And, well, I don''t really know</span> <span m=''2772000''>how to draw it well,
  but it should be something like</span> <span m=''2780000''>this. OK, so now if you
  want to try</span> <span m=''2784000''>to set up that double integral, sorry, the
  triple integral,</span> <span m=''2789000''>well, so let''s say we do it in rectangular
  coordinates because</span> <span m=''2797000''>we are really evil. [LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m=''2801000''>So then, the bottom surface, OK, so we do it with z first.</span>
  <span m=''2803000''>So, the bottom surface is the slanted plane.</span> <span m=''2806000''>So,
  the bottom value would be z equals one minus y.</span> <span m=''2811000''>The top
  value is on the sphere. So, the sphere corresponds to z</span> <span m=''2816000''>equals
  square root of one minus x squared minus y squared.</span> <span m=''2821000''>So,
  you''d go from the plane to the sphere.</span> <span m=''2825000''>And then, to
  find the bounds for x and y, you have to figure</span> <span m=''2829000''>out what
  exactly, what the heck is this region</span> <span m=''2833000''>here? So, what
  is this region?</span> <span m=''2835000''>Well, we have to figure out, for what
  values of x and y the</span> <span m=''2839000''>plane is below the ellipse. So,
  the condition is that,</span> <span m=''2843000''>sorry, the plane is below the
  sphere.</span> <span m=''2845000''>OK, so, that''s when the plane is below the sphere.</span>
  <span m=''2851000''>That means one minus y is less than square root of one minus
  x</span> <span m=''2857000''>squared minus y squared. So, you have to somehow</span>
  <span m=''2861000''>manipulate this to extract something simpler.</span> <span m=''2863000''>Well,
  probably the only way to do it is to square both sides,</span> <span m=''2867000''>one
  minus y squared should be less than one minus x squared</span> <span m=''2871000''>minus
  y squared. And, if you work hard enough,</span> <span m=''2875000''>you''ll find
  quite an ugly equation.</span> <span m=''2877000''>But, you can figure out what
  are, then, the bounds for x</span> <span m=''2880000''>given y, and then set up
  the integral?</span> <span m=''2883000''>So, just to give you a hint, the bounds
  on y will be zero to</span> <span m=''2886000''>one. The bounds on x,</span> <span
  m=''2889000''>well, I''m not sure you want to see them,</span> <span m=''2890000''>but
  in case you do, it will be from negative square</span> <span m=''2894000''>root
  of 2y minus 2y squared to square root of 2y minus 2y</span> <span m=''2898000''>squared.
  So, exercise,</span> <span m=''2900000''>figure out how I got these by starting
  from that.</span> <span m=''2905000''>Now, of course, if we just wanted the volume
  of</span> <span m=''2907000''>this guy, we wouldn''t do it this way.</span> <span
  m=''2908000''>We do symmetry, and actually we''d rotate the</span> <span m=''2911000''>thing
  so that our spherical cap was actually centered on the z</span> <span m=''2914000''>axis
  because that would be a much easier way to set it up.</span> <span m=''2917000''>But,
  depending on what function we are integrating,</span> <span m=''2919000''>we can''t
  always do that.</span> </p>'
