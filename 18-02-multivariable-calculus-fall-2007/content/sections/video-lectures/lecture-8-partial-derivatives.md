  \ at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='23000'>So, so far, we've seen things about vectors,</span>\
  \ <span m='25000'>equation of planes, motions in space,</span> <span m='27000'>and\
  \ so on. Basically we've done geometry</span> <span m='30000'>in space. But, calculus,</span>\
  \ <span m='31000'>really, is about studying functions.</span> <span m='33000'>Now,\
  \ we're going to actually move on to studying functions of</span> <span m='37000'>several\
  \ variables. So, this new unit,</span> <span m='40000'>what we'll do over the next\
  \ three weeks or so will be about</span> <span m='45000'>functions of several variables\
  \ and their derivatives.</span> <span m='50000'>OK, so first of all, we should try\
  \ to figure out how</span> <span m='55000'>we are going to think about functions.</span>\
  \ <span m='58000'>So, remember, if you have a function of one</span> <span m='62000'>variable,\
  \ that means you have a quantity that depends on one</span> <span m='68000'>parameter.\
  \ Maybe f depends on the variable</span> <span m='72000'>x. And, for example,</span>\
  \ <span m='74000'>a function that you all know is f of x equals sin(x).</span> <span\
  \ m='79000'>And, the way we would represent that is maybe just by plotting</span>\
  \ <span m='82000'>the graph of the function. So, the graph of a function,</span>\
  \ <span m='88000'>we plot y = f(x). And, the graph of a sine</span> <span m='94000'>function\
  \ that looks like this. OK, so now, let's say that we</span> <span m='105000'>had,\
  \ actually, a function of two variables.</span> <span m='113000'>So, that means\
  \ that the value of F depends actually on two</span> <span m='116000'>different\
  \ parameters, say, if the variables are x and</span> <span m='119000'>y, or they\
  \ can have any names you</span> <span m='123000'>want. So, given values of the two</span>\
  \ <span m='127000'>parameters, x and y, the function will give us a</span> <span\
  \ m='133000'>number that we'll call f(x, y).</span> <span m='137000'>That depends\
  \ on x and y according to some formula,</span> <span m='141000'>OK, not very surprising\
  \ so far. So, for example,</span> <span m='149000'>I can give you the function f(x,\
  \ y) = x^2 y^2.</span> <span m='164000'>And, of course, as with functions of one</span>\
  \ <span m='167000'>variable, we don't need things to be defined everywhere.</span>\
  \ <span m='170000'>Sometimes there is the domain of definition.</span> <span m='173000'>So,\
  \ this one is defined all the time.</span> <span m='177000'>But, if I tell you,\
  \ say, f of x,</span> <span m='181000'>y equals square root of y, well, this is\
  \ only defined if y</span> <span m='188000'>is nonnegative. If I tell you f(x,</span>\
  \ <span m='194000'>y) equals one over x y, that's only defined if x y is</span>\
  \ <span m='203000'>not zero, and so on. Now, so these are mathematical</span> <span\
  \ m='210000'>examples given by explicit formulas.</span> <span m='213000'>And, of\
  \ course, there's physical examples.</span> <span m='215000'>For example, so examples\
  \ coming from real</span> <span m='218000'>life, so for example, you can look at\
  \ the temperature</span> <span m='220000'>at the certain point on the surface of\
  \ the earth.</span> <span m='223000'>So, you use maybe longitude and latitude; that's\
  \ x and y.</span> <span m='226000'>And then you have f(x, y) equals the temperature\
  \ at</span> <span m='229000'>that point.</span> <span m='252000'>In fact, because\
  \ temperature depends also may be on how high</span> <span m='257000'>up you are.\
  \ It depends on elevation.</span> <span m='258000'>So, it's actually a function\
  \ of maybe x, y, z.</span> <span m='261000'>And, it also depends on time. So, in\
  \ fact,</span> <span m='264000'>maybe it's a function of t in x y z coordinates\
  \ in space.</span> <span m='268000'>So, you see that real-world functions can depends\
  \ on a lot</span> <span m='271000'>of variables. So, our goal will be to</span>\
  \ <span m='273000'>understand how to deal with that.</span> <span m='297000'>OK,\
  \ so now you will see very soon, but actually it's already</span> <span m='301000'>tricky\
  \ enough to picture a function of two variables.</span> <span m='305000'>So, we\
  \ are going to focus on the case of functions of two</span> <span m='308000'>variables.\
  \ And then, we'll see that if we</span> <span m='310000'>have more than two variables,\
  \ then it's harder to plot the</span> <span m='312000'>function. We cannot draw\
  \ with the graph</span> <span m='314000'>looks like anymore. But, the tools are\
  \ the same,</span> <span m='317000'>the notion of partial derivatives, grade and\
  \ vector,</span> <span m='320000'>and so on, all the tools that we will</span> <span\
  \ m='323000'>develop work exactly the same way no matter how many variables</span>\
  \ <span m='327000'>you have. So, I'll say,</span> <span m='330000'>for simplicity\
  \ -- -- we'll focus mostly on two or sometimes</span> <span m='341000'>three variables.\
  \ But, it works the same in any</span> <span m='348000'>number of variables. OK,\
  \ so the first question is</span> <span m='356000'>how to visualize a function of\
  \ two variables.</span> <span m='365000'>So, the first thing we can do is try to\
  \ draw the graph of f.</span> <span m='370000'>So, maybe I should say f -- which\
  \ is a function of two</span> <span m='379000'>variables. So, the first answer will\
  \ be,</span> <span m='383000'>we can try to look at it's graph.</span> <span m='386000'>And,\
  \ the idea is the same as with one variable,</span> <span m='389000'>namely, we\
  \ look at all the possible values of the</span> <span m='391000'>parameters, x and\
  \ y, and for each of them,</span> <span m='394000'>we plot a point whose height\
  \ is the value of a function at these</span> <span m='400000'>parameters. So, we'll\
  \ plot,</span> <span m='403000'>let's say, z equals f(x, y).</span> <span m='407000'>And,\
  \ now that will become, actually, a surface in space.</span> <span m='412000'>OK,\
  \ so for each value of x and y, yeah, we have x,</span> <span m='417000'>y in the\
  \ x, y plane, then we'll plot the point in</span> <span m='422000'>space at position\
  \ x, y.</span> <span m='425000'>And, z equals f of x, y. OK, and if we take all\
  \ of these</span> <span m='433000'>points together, they will give us some surface</span>\
  \ <span m='437000'>that sits in space. Yes?</span> <span m='444000'>Oh, a function\
  \ of two variables, shorthand.</span> <span m='449000'>Well, let's say how to visualize\
  \ a function of two</span> <span m='456000'>variables. OK, so, how do we do that</span>\
  \ <span m='459000'>concretely? Say that I give you a formula</span> <span m='461000'>for\
  \ f. How do we try to represent it?</span> <span m='466000'>So, let's do our first\
  \ example. Let's say I give you a function</span> <span m='477000'>f(x, y) = -y.\
  \ OK, so it looks a little bit</span> <span m='482000'>silly because it doesn't\
  \ depend on x.</span> <span m='484000'>But, that's not the problem. It's still a\
  \ valid function of</span> <span m='490000'>x and y. It just happens to be constant</span>\
  \ <span m='493000'>with respect to x. So, to draw the graph we look</span> <span\
  \ m='497000'>at the surface in space defined by z equals y.</span> <span m='502000'>What\
  \ kind of surface is that? It's a plane, OK?</span> <span m='506000'>And, if we\
  \ want to draw it, z equals minus y will look,</span> <span m='512000'>well, let's\
  \ put y axis. Let's put x axis.</span> <span m='516000'>Let's put z axis. If I look\
  \ at what happens in</span> <span m='519000'>the y, z plane in the plane of a blackboard,\
  \ it will just look</span> <span m='523000'>like a line that goes downward with\
  \ slope one.</span> <span m='525000'>OK, so it will be this. And, what happens if\
  \ I change x?</span> <span m='531000'>Well, if I change x, nothing happens because\
  \ x</span> <span m='534000'>doesn't appear in this equation. So, in fact,</span>\
  \ <span m='537000'>if instead of setting x equal to zero I set x equal to one,</span>\
  \ <span m='541000'>I'm in front of the blackboard, or minus one at the back.</span>\
  \ <span m='544000'>Well, it still looks exactly the same.</span> <span m='547000'>So,\
  \ I have this plane that actually contains the x axis and</span> <span m='555000'>slopes\
  \ downwards with slope one. It's kind of hard to draw.</span> <span m='562000'>Now,\
  \ you see immediately what the big problem with graphs will</span> <span m='565000'>be.\
  \ But, these pictures are hard to</span> <span m='569000'>read. But that's our first\
  \ graph.</span> <span m='574000'>OK, a question so far? OK, so let's say that we\
  \ have a</span> <span m='581000'>slightly more complicated function.</span> <span\
  \ m='583000'>How do we see it? So, let's draw another example.</span> <span m='590000'>Let's\
  \ say I give you f(x, y) = 1 - x^2-y^2.</span> <span m='598000'>So, we should try\
  \ to picture what the surface z=1- x^2-y^2</span> <span m='606000'>looks like. So,\
  \ how do we do that?</span> <span m='610000'>Well, maybe you are very fast and figured\
  \ out what it looks</span> <span m='615000'>like. But, if not,</span> <span m='617000'>then\
  \ we need to work piece by piece.</span> <span m='621000'>So, maybe it will help\
  \ if we understand first what it does in</span> <span m='627000'>the plane of the\
  \ blackboard. So, if we look at it in the y,</span> <span m='635000'>z plane, that\
  \ means we set x equal to zero.</span> <span m='642000'>And then, z becomes 1 -\
  \ y^2. What is that?</span> <span m='648000'>It's a parabola pointing downwards,\
  \ and starting at one.</span> <span m='654000'>So, we should draw maybe this downward\
  \ parabola.</span> <span m='660000'>It starts at one and it cuts the y axis at one.</span>\
  \ <span m='668000'>When y is one, that gives us zero.</span> <span m='671000'>So,\
  \ we might have an idea of what it might look like,</span> <span m='675000'>or maybe\
  \ not. Let's get more slices.</span> <span m='679000'>Let's see what it does in\
  \ the x, z plane, this other vertical</span> <span m='687000'>plane that's coming\
  \ towards us. So, in the x,</span> <span m='693000'>z plane, if we set y equal to\
  \ zero, we get z equals one minus</span> <span m='698000'>x^2. It's, again,</span>\
  \ <span m='700000'>a parabola going downwards. OK, so I'm going to try to draw</span>\
  \ <span m='706000'>a parabola that goes downward, but now to the front and to the</span>\
  \ <span m='711000'>back. So, we are starting to have a</span> <span m='714000'>slightly\
  \ better idea but we still don't know whether the</span> <span m='717000'>cross\
  \ section of this thing might be round,</span> <span m='719000'>square, something\
  \ else. So, it wants more confirmation.</span> <span m='724000'>We might want to\
  \ also figure out where the surface intersects</span> <span m='736000'>the x, y\
  \ plane. So, we hit the x,</span> <span m='742000'>y plane when z equals zero. That\
  \ means 1-x^2-y^2 should be</span> <span m='749000'>0, that becomes x^2 y^2 = 1.\
  \ That is a circle of radius 1.</span> <span m='758000'>That's the unit size. So,\
  \ that means that here,</span> <span m='766000'>we actually have the unit circle.</span>\
  \ <span m='770000'>And now, you should imagine that you have this thing that</span>\
  \ <span m='774000'>when you slice it by a vertical plane, looks like a downwards</span>\
  \ <span m='777000'>parabola. And, it's actually a surface of</span> <span m='780000'>revolution.\
  \ You can rotate it around the z</span> <span m='783000'>axis, OK? Now, if you stare\
  \ long enough</span> <span m='786000'>at that equation, you'll actually see that,</span>\
  \ <span m='789000'>yes, we know that it had to be like that.</span> <span m='792000'>But,\
  \ see, so these are useful ways of trying to guess what the</span> <span m='797000'>graph\
  \ looks like. Of course, the other way is to</span> <span m='799000'>just ask your\
  \ computer to do it. And then, you know,</span> <span m='804000'>you will get that\
  \ kind of formula.</span> <span m='810000'>OK, well, I can leave it on if you want.</span>\
  \ <span m='816000'>No, because I plotted a different function that I will</span>\
  \ <span m='820000'>show you later. So, it goes this way.</span> <span m='823000'>I\
  \ mean, if you want, it's really going downward.</span> <span m='826000'>Yes, I\
  \ agree that the sheet is upside down.</span> <span m='829000'>That's because I\
  \ plotted something else.</span> <span m='832000'>OK, so, in fact, so I plotted\
  \ in my computer was</span> <span m='838000'>actually x^2 y^2 that looks like that.</span>\
  \ <span m='843000'>See, it's the same with a parabola going upwards.</span> <span\
  \ m='848000'>If you want to see more examples, I have various</span> <span m='854000'>examples\
  \ to show, well, here's the graph,</span> <span m='859000'>y^2-x^2. See, so that\
  \ one is kind of</span> <span m='861000'>interesting. It looks like a saddle.</span>\
  \ <span m='863000'>If you look at it in the y, z plane, then it's a parabola</span>\
  \ <span m='869000'>going up, z = y^2. And, that's what we see to the</span> <span\
  \ m='874000'>left and to the right. But, if you put it in the x,</span> <span m='878000'>z\
  \ plane, then that's a parabola going downwards,</span> <span m='882000'>z = - x^2.\
  \ So, we have a parabola going</span> <span m='885000'>downwards in one direction,\
  \ upwards in the other one.</span> <span m='888000'>And together, they form this\
  \ surface.</span> <span m='893000'>And of course, you can plot much more</span>\
  \ <span m='895000'>complicated functions. So, this one,</span> <span m='898000'>well,\
  \ if you can read very small things,</span> <span m='900000'>you can see the formula.\
  \ It doesn't matter,</span> <span m='903000'>just to show you that you can put a\
  \ formula into a computer:</span> <span m='909000'>it will show you a picture. OK,\
  \ so that's pretty good.</span> <span m='918000'>I mean, you can see that it can\
  \ get a bit cluttered because</span> <span m='920000'>maybe those features that\
  \ are hidden behind,</span> <span m='922000'>or maybe we have trouble seeing if\
  \ we don't have a computer,</span> <span m='925000'>that looks very readable. But,\
  \ this is kind of hard to</span> <span m='929000'>visualize sometimes. So, there\
  \ is another way to</span> <span m='933000'>plot the functions of two variables.</span>\
  \ <span m='936000'>And, let's call it the contour plot.</span> <span m='947000'>So,\
  \ the contour plot is a very elegant solution to the problem</span> <span m='951000'>that\
  \ it's difficult to draw to space pictures on a sheet of</span> <span m='955000'>paper\
  \ or on a blackboard. So, instead,</span> <span m='958000'>let's try to represent\
  \ the function of two variables by</span> <span m='962000'>just the map, you know,\
  \ the same way that</span> <span m='964000'>when you walk around, you have actually\
  \ geographical</span> <span m='967000'>maps that fit on a piece of paper that tell\
  \ you about what</span> <span m='971000'>the real world looks like. So, what contour\
  \ plot looks</span> <span m='977000'>something like this? So, it's an x, y plot.</span>\
  \ <span m='982000'>And, that, you have a bunch of curves.</span> <span m='985000'>And,\
  \ what the curves represent are the elevations on the graph.</span> <span m='992000'>So,\
  \ for example, this curve might correspond to</span> <span m='995000'>all the points\
  \ where f(x, y) = 1.</span> <span m='997000'>And, that curve might be all the points\
  \ where f=2 and f=3 and</span> <span m='1006000'>so on, OK? So, when you see you\
  \ this kind</span> <span m='1009000'>of plot, you're supposed to think that the\
  \ graph of the</span> <span m='1013000'>function sits somewhere in space above that.</span>\
  \ <span m='1016000'>It's like a map telling you how high things are.</span> <span\
  \ m='1020000'>And, what you would want to do with the function,</span> <span m='1023000'>really,\
  \ is be able to tell quickly what's the value at a</span> <span m='1026000'>given\
  \ point? Well, let's say I want to look</span> <span m='1028000'>at that point.\
  \ I know that f is somewhere</span> <span m='1031000'>between 1 and 2. Actually,\
  \ it's much faster to</span> <span m='1034000'>read than the graph. On the graph\
  \ I might have to</span> <span m='1037000'>look carefully, and then measure things,</span>\
  \ <span m='1038000'>and so on. Here, I can just raise the</span> <span m='1042000'>value\
  \ of f by comparing with the nearby lines.</span> <span m='1047000'>OK, so let me\
  \ try to make that more precise.</span> <span m='1051000'>So, it shows all the points\
  \ -- -- where f(x,</span> <span m='1061000'>y) equals some fixed values, some fixed\
  \ constants.</span> <span m='1073000'>And, these constants typically are chosen\
  \ at regular intervals.</span> <span m='1085000'>For example, here I chose one,</span>\
  \ <span m='1087000'>two, three, and they could continue with zero minus one,</span>\
  \ <span m='1091000'>and so on. So, one way to think about it,</span> <span m='1096000'>how\
  \ does this relate to the graph?</span> <span m='1101000'>Well, that's the same\
  \ thing as cutting, I mean,</span> <span m='1111000'>we slice the graph by horizontal\
  \ planes.</span> <span m='1120000'>So, horizontal planes have equations of a form\
  \ z equals</span> <span m='1124000'>some constant, z equals zero,</span> <span m='1126000'>z\
  \ equals one, z equals two,</span> <span m='1128000'>and so on. So, maybe the graph\
  \ of my</span> <span m='1131000'>function will be some sort of plot out there.</span>\
  \ <span m='1135000'>And, if I slice it by the plane z equals one,</span> <span m='1140000'>then\
  \ I will get the level curve,</span> <span m='1144000'>which is the point where\
  \ f(x, y) = 1,</span> <span m='1154000'>and so, that's called a level curve of f.</span>\
  \ <span m='1164000'>OK, and so we repeat the process with maybe z equals two,</span>\
  \ <span m='1172000'>and we get another level curve, and so on.</span> <span m='1178000'>And,\
  \ then we squish all of them up, and that's how we get the</span> <span m='1184000'>contour\
  \ plot. OK, so each of these lines,</span> <span m='1187000'>imagine that this is\
  \ like some mountain or something that you</span> <span m='1190000'>are hiking on.\
  \ Each of these lines tells you</span> <span m='1192000'>how you could move to stay\
  \ at a constant height if you want to</span> <span m='1195000'>get to the other\
  \ side of the mountain but without ever going</span> <span m='1198000'>up or down.\
  \ You would just walk along that</span> <span m='1203000'>path, and it will get\
  \ you there without effort.</span> <span m='1208000'>So, in fact, if you have been\
  \ talking about</span> <span m='1211000'>hiking on mountains, well, that's exactly\
  \ what a</span> <span m='1215000'>topographical map is about. So, I need to zoom\
  \ a bit.</span> <span m='1221000'>So, a topographic map, this one from the US geological</span>\
  \ <span m='1227000'>survey shows you, basically, all the level curves</span> <span\
  \ m='1232000'>of an altitude function on a piece of land.</span> <span m='1237000'>So,\
  \ you know that if you walk right along these curves,</span> <span m='1240000'>you\
  \ will stay along the same height.</span> <span m='1242000'>And you know that if\
  \ you walk towards, these don't have</span> <span m='1246000'>numbers. Let me find\
  \ a place with</span> <span m='1248000'>numbers. Here, there is a 500 in the</span>\
  \ <span m='1253000'>middle. So, you know that if you walk</span> <span m='1256000'>on\
  \ the line that says 500, you stay always at 500 meters</span> <span m='1259000'>in\
  \ elevation. If you walk towards the</span> <span m='1262000'>mountain that I think\
  \ is below it, then you will go up,</span> <span m='1265000'>and so on. So, you\
  \ can see,</span> <span m='1267000'>for example, here there's a peak,</span> <span\
  \ m='1270000'>and here there is a valley with the river in it,</span> <span m='1273000'>and\
  \ the altitudes go down, and then back up again on the</span> <span m='1277000'>other\
  \ side. OK, so that's an example of a</span> <span m='1279000'>contour plot of a\
  \ function. Of course, we don't have a</span> <span m='1282000'>formula for that\
  \ function, but we have a contour plot,</span> <span m='1285000'>and that's what\
  \ we need actually to understand what's</span> <span m='1289000'>going on there.\
  \ OK, any questions?</span> <span m='1296000'>No? OK, so another example of</span>\
  \ <span m='1299000'>contour plots, well, you've probably seen</span> <span m='1302000'>various\
  \ versions of these temperature maps.</span> <span m='1306000'>So, that's supposed\
  \ to be how warm it is right now.</span> <span m='1311000'>So, this one is color-coded.\
  \ Instead of having curves,</span> <span m='1315000'>it has all these colors. But,\
  \ the effect is the same.</span> <span m='1318000'>If you look at the separations\
  \ between consecutive colors,</span> <span m='1321000'>these are the level curves\
  \ of a function that tells you the</span> <span m='1325000'>temperature at a given\
  \ point. OK, so these are examples of</span> <span m='1332000'>contour plots in\
  \ real life. OK, no questions?</span> <span m='1344000'>No? OK, so basically,</span>\
  \ <span m='1346000'>one of the goals that one should try to achieve at this</span>\
  \ <span m='1351000'>point is becoming familiar with the contour plot,</span> <span\
  \ m='1355000'>the graph, and how to view and deal with</span> <span m='1358000'>functions.</span>\
  \ <span m='1374000'>[APPLAUSE] OK, so -- Let's do an example.</span> <span m='1382000'>Well,\
  \ let's do a couple of examples.</span> <span m='1384000'>So, let's start with f(x,y)\
  \ = - y.</span> <span m='1388000'>And, I'm going to take the same two examples as\
  \ there to start</span> <span m='1392000'>with so that we see the relation between\
  \ the graph and the</span> <span m='1396000'>contour plots. So, let's try to plot\
  \ it.</span> <span m='1403000'>So, we are asked for the level curve, f equals 0\
  \ for this one?</span> <span m='1410000'>Well, f is zero when y is zero. So, that's\
  \ the x axis.</span> <span m='1418000'>OK, so that's the level, zero. Where's the\
  \ level one?</span> <span m='1424000'>Well, f is one when negative y is one.</span>\
  \ <span m='1428000'>That means when y is negative one.</span> <span m='1431000'>So,\
  \ you go to minus one, and that will be where my level</span> <span m='1437000'>one\
  \ is, and so on. f is two when y is negative</span> <span m='1442000'>two. F is\
  \ negative one when y is</span> <span m='1446000'>one, and so on. Is that convincing?</span>\
  \ <span m='1450000'>Do you see how we got that? OK, let me do it again.</span> <span\
  \ m='1455000'>I don't see anybody nodding, so that's kind of bad news.</span> <span\
  \ m='1458000'>So, if I want to know, where is the level curve,</span> <span m='1462000'>say,\
  \ one, I try to set f equals to one.</span> <span m='1466000'>Let's do this one.\
  \ f equals one means that</span> <span m='1471000'>negative y is one means that\
  \ y is minus one,</span> <span m='1476000'>and y equals minus one is this horizontal\
  \ line on this chart.</span> <span m='1483000'>OK, and same with the others. So,\
  \ you can see on the map that</span> <span m='1487000'>the value of a function doesn't\
  \ depend on x.</span> <span m='1489000'>If you move parallel to the x axis, nothing\
  \ happens.</span> <span m='1492000'>If you move in the y direction, it decreases\
  \ at a constant</span> <span m='1496000'>rate. That's why the contours are</span>\
  \ <span m='1499000'>evenly spaced. How spaced out they are tells</span> <span m='1503000'>you,\
  \ actually, how steep things are.</span> <span m='1506000'>So, that corresponds\
  \ exactly to that picture,</span> <span m='1508000'>except that here we draw x coming\
  \ to the front,</span> <span m='1511000'>and y to the right. So, you have to rotate\
  \ the map</span> <span m='1514000'>by 90\uFFFD to get to that. It's an unfortunate\
  \ consequence</span> <span m='1519000'>of the usual way of plotting things in space.</span>\
  \ <span m='1524000'>OK, so these horizontal lines here correspond actually to</span>\
  \ <span m='1532000'>horizontal lines here.</span> <span m='1543000'>OK, second example.\
  \ Let's do 1-x^2-y^2.</span> <span m='1554000'>OK, or maybe I will write it as 1\
  \ - (x^2 y^2).</span> <span m='1560000'>It's really the same thing. So, x, y, let's\
  \ see,</span> <span m='1566000'>where is this function equal to zero?</span> <span\
  \ m='1572000'>Well, we said f is zero in the unit circle.</span> <span m='1581000'>OK,\
  \ so, the zero level, well, let's say that this is my</span> <span m='1592000'>unit.\
  \ That's where it's at zero.</span> <span m='1596000'>What about f equals one? Well,\
  \ that's when x^2 y^2 = 0.</span> <span m='1608000'>Well, that's only going to be\
  \ here.</span> <span m='1609000'>So, that's just a single point. What about f equals\
  \ minus one?</span> <span m='1620000'>That's when x^2 y^2 =2. That's a circle of\
  \ radius</span> <span m='1627000'>square root of two, which is about 1.4.</span>\
  \ <span m='1630000'>So, it's somewhere here. Then, minus two,</span> <span m='1637000'>similarly,\
  \ will be x^2 y^2 = 3. Square root of three is about</span> <span m='1644000'>1.7.\
  \ And then, minus three will be</span> <span m='1647000'>of radius two, and so on.</span>\
  \ <span m='1650000'>So, what I want to show here is that they are getting closer\
  \ and</span> <span m='1658000'>closer apart, OK?</span> <span m='1661000'>So, first\
  \ it's concentric circles that tells us that we</span> <span m='1664000'>have a\
  \ shape that's a solid of the graph is going to be a</span> <span m='1667000'>surface\
  \ of revolution. Things don't change if I rotate.</span> <span m='1672000'>And second,\
  \ the level curves are getting closer and closer to</span> <span m='1676000'>each\
  \ other. That means it's getting steeper</span> <span m='1679000'>and steeper because\
  \ I have to travel a shorter distance if I</span> <span m='1683000'>want my altitude\
  \ to change by one.</span> <span m='1686000'>OK, so, this top here is kind of flat.</span>\
  \ <span m='1689000'>And then it gets steeper and steeper.</span> <span m='1691000'>And,\
  \ that's what we observe on that picture there.</span> <span m='1696000'>OK, so\
  \ just to show you a few more, where did I put my,</span> <span m='1704000'>so,\
  \ for x^2 y^2, the contour plot looks like</span> <span m='1710000'>this. Maybe\
  \ actually I'll make it.</span> <span m='1717000'>OK, so it looks exactly the same\
  \ as this one.</span> <span m='1721000'>But, the difference is if you can see the\
  \ numbers which are</span> <span m='1724000'>not there, so you can see them,</span>\
  \ <span m='1725000'>then you would know that instead of decreasing as we move</span>\
  \ <span m='1729000'>out, this one is increasing as we go</span> <span m='1732000'>out.\
  \ OK, so that's where we use,</span> <span m='1734000'>actually, the labels on the\
  \ level curves that tell us</span> <span m='1737000'>whether things are going up\
  \ or down.</span> <span m='1740000'>But, the contour plots look exactly the same.</span>\
  \ <span m='1744000'>For the next one I had, I think, was y^2-x^2.</span> <span m='1754000'>So,\
  \ the contour plot, well, let me actually zoom out.</span> <span m='1758000'>So,\
  \ the contour plot looks like that.</span> <span m='1760000'>So, the level curve\
  \ corresponding to zero is</span> <span m='1763000'>actually two diagonal lines.\
  \ And, if you look on the plot,</span> <span m='1767000'>say that you started at\
  \ the saddle point in the middle and</span> <span m='1770000'>you try to stay at\
  \ the same level.</span> <span m='1773000'>So, it looks like a mountain pass, right?</span>\
  \ <span m='1775000'>Well, there's actually four directions from that point that</span>\
  \ <span m='1778000'>you can go staying at the same height.</span> <span m='1781000'>And\
  \ actually, on the map, they look exactly</span> <span m='1784000'>like this, too,\
  \ these crossing lines.</span> <span m='1786000'>OK, so, these are things that go\
  \ on the side of the two</span> <span m='1789000'>mountains that are to the left\
  \ and right, and stay at the same</span> <span m='1793000'>height as the mountain\
  \ pass. On the other hand,</span> <span m='1797000'>if you go along the y direction,\
  \ to the left or to the</span> <span m='1801000'>right, then you go towards positive\
  \ values.</span> <span m='1805000'>And, if you go along the x axis, then you get\
  \ towards</span> <span m='1811000'>negative values. OK, the equation for,</span>\
  \ <span m='1818000'>the function was y^2-x^2. So, you can try to plot them by</span>\
  \ <span m='1825000'>hand and confirmed that it does look like that.</span> <span\
  \ m='1827000'>But, I trust my computer. And, finally,</span> <span m='1833000'>this\
  \ one, well, so the contour plot looks a bit</span> <span m='1839000'>complicated.\
  \ But, you can see two things.</span> <span m='1843000'>In the middle, you can see\
  \ these two origins</span> <span m='1845000'>with these concentric circles which\
  \ are not really circles,</span> <span m='1847000'>but, you know, these closed curves\
  \ that are</span> <span m='1850000'>concentric. And, they correspond to the two</span>\
  \ <span m='1853000'>mountains. And then, at some point in the</span> <span m='1856000'>middle,\
  \ we have a mountain pass. And there, we see the two</span> <span m='1860000'>crossing\
  \ lines again, like, on the plot of y^2-x^2.</span> <span m='1865000'>And so, at\
  \ this saddle point here, if we go north or south,</span> <span m='1871000'>then\
  \ we go down on either side to the Valley.</span> <span m='1875000'>And, if we go\
  \ east or west, then we go towards the</span> <span m='1877000'>mountains. We'll\
  \ go up.</span> <span m='1881000'>OK, does that make sense a little bit?</span>\
  \ <span m='1886000'>OK, so, reading plots is not easy, but hopefully we'll get</span>\
  \ <span m='1891000'>used to it very soon.</span> <span m='1904000'>OK, so actually\
  \ let's say, well, OK, so,</span> <span m='1909000'>I want to point out one thing.\
  \ The contour plot tells us,</span> <span m='1915000'>actually, what happens when\
  \ we move, when we change x and y.</span> <span m='1920000'>So, if I change the\
  \ value of x and y, that means I'm moving</span> <span m='1925000'>east-west or\
  \ north-south on the map.</span> <span m='1928000'>And then, I can ask myself, is\
  \ the value of the function</span> <span m='1932000'>increase or decrease in each\
  \ of these situations?</span> <span m='1935000'>Well, that's the kind of thing that\
  \ the contour plot can tell</span> <span m='1938000'>me very quickly.</span> <span\
  \ m='1974000'>So -- OK, so say, for example,</span> <span m='1976000'>that I have\
  \ a piece of contour plot.</span> <span m='1979000'>That looks, you know, like that.</span>\
  \ <span m='1981000'>Maybe this is f equals one, and this is f equals two.</span>\
  \ <span m='1986000'>And here, this is f equals zero. And, let's say that I start\
  \ at</span> <span m='1993000'>the point, say, at this point.</span> <span m='1997000'>OK,\
  \ so here I have (x0, y0). And, the question I might ask</span> <span m='2003000'>myself\
  \ is if I change x or y, how does f change?</span> <span m='2006000'>Well, the contour\
  \ plot tells me that if x increases,</span> <span m='2014000'>and I keep y constant,\
  \ then what happens to f(x,</span> <span m='2021000'>y)? Well, it will increase\
  \ because</span> <span m='2024000'>if I move to the right, then I go from one to\
  \ a value</span> <span m='2027000'>bigger than one. I don't know exactly how much,</span>\
  \ <span m='2030000'>but I know that somewhere between one and two,</span> <span\
  \ m='2033000'>it's more than one. If x decreases,</span> <span m='2037000'>then\
  \ f decreases. And, similarly,</span> <span m='2042000'>I can tell that if y increases,\
  \ then f, well,</span> <span m='2047000'>it looks like if I increase y, then f will\
  \ also increase.</span> <span m='2054000'>And, if y decreases, then f decreases.</span>\
  \ <span m='2060000'>And, that's the kind of qualitative analysis that we can</span>\
  \ <span m='2063000'>do easily from the contour plot. But, maybe we'd like to</span>\
  \ <span m='2067000'>actually be more precise in that, and tell how fast f</span>\
  \ <span m='2070000'>changes if I change x or y. OK, so to find the rate of</span>\
  \ <span m='2074000'>change, that's exactly where we use derivatives.</span> <span\
  \ m='2079000'>So -- So, we are going to have to deal with partial</span> <span m='2087000'>derivatives.\
  \ So, I will explain to you soon</span> <span m='2098000'>why partial. So, let me\
  \ just remind you</span> <span m='2105000'>first, if you have a function of one\
  \ variable,</span> <span m='2112000'>then so let's say f of x, then you have a derivative,</span>\
  \ <span m='2118000'>f prime of x is also called df/dx.</span> <span m='2122000'>And,\
  \ it's defined as a limit when delta x goes to zero of the</span> <span m='2131000'>change\
  \ in f. Sorry, it's not going to fit.</span> <span m='2135000'>I have to go to the\
  \ next line. It's going to be the limit as</span> <span m='2142000'>delta x goes\
  \ to zero of the rate of change.</span> <span m='2147000'>So, the change in f between\
  \ x and x plus delta x divided by</span> <span m='2152000'>delta x. Sometimes you\
  \ write delta f for</span> <span m='2156000'>the change in f divided by delta x.</span>\
  \ <span m='2159000'>And then, you take the limit of this rate of increase as delta\
  \ x</span> <span m='2164000'>goes to zero. Now, of course,</span> <span m='2165000'>if\
  \ you have a formula for f, then you know,</span> <span m='2168000'>at least you\
  \ should know, I suspect most of you know how</span> <span m='2172000'>to actually\
  \ take the derivative of a function from its formula.</span> <span m='2179000'>So\
  \ -- Now, how do we do that? Sorry, and I should also tell</span> <span m='2190000'>you\
  \ what this means on the graph.</span> <span m='2192000'>So, if I plot the graph\
  \ of a function, and to have my point,</span> <span m='2196000'>x, and here I have\
  \ f of x, how do I see the derivative?</span> <span m='2201000'>Well, I look at\
  \ the tangent line to the graph,</span> <span m='2208000'>and the slope of the tangent\
  \ line is f prime of x,</span> <span m='2215000'>OK? And, not every function has\
  \ a</span> <span m='2219000'>derivative. You have functions that are not</span>\
  \ <span m='2223000'>regular enough to actually have a derivative.</span> <span m='2225000'>So,\
  \ in this class, we are not going to actually</span> <span m='2228000'>worry too\
  \ much about differentiability.</span> <span m='2231000'>But, it's good, at least,\
  \ to be aware that you</span> <span m='2236000'>can't always take the derivative.</span>\
  \ <span m='2239000'>So, yes, and what else do I want to remind you of?</span> <span\
  \ m='2244000'>Well, they also have an approximation formula -- --</span> <span m='2252000'>which\
  \ says that, you know, if we have the value</span> <span m='2259000'>of f at some\
  \ point, x0,</span> <span m='2261000'>and that we want to find the value at a nearby\
  \ point,</span> <span m='2267000'>x close to x0, then our best guess is that</span>\
  \ <span m='2271000'>it's f of x0 plus the derivative f prime at x0 times delta x,</span>\
  \ <span m='2278000'>or if you want, x minus x0, OK?</span> <span m='2282000'>Is\
  \ this kind of familiar to you? Yeah, I mean,</span> <span m='2286000'>maybe with\
  \ different notations. Maybe you called that delta x</span> <span m='2289000'>or\
  \ something. Maybe you called that x0 plus h</span> <span m='2292000'>or something.\
  \ But, it's the usual</span> <span m='2294000'>approximation formula using the derivative.</span>\
  \ <span m='2298000'>If you put more terms, then you get the dreaded Taylor</span>\
  \ <span m='2301000'>approximation that I know you guys don't like.</span> <span\
  \ m='2304000'>So, the question is how do we do the same for a function of</span>\
  \ <span m='2316000'>two variables, f(x, y)?</span> <span m='2321000'>So, the difficulty\
  \ there is we can change x,</span> <span m='2325000'>or we can change y, or we can\
  \ change both.</span> <span m='2329000'>And, presumably, the manner in which f changes</span>\
  \ <span m='2332000'>will be different depending on whether we change x or y.</span>\
  \ <span m='2336000'>So, that's why we have several different notions of derivative.</span>\
  \ <span m='2364000'>So, OK, we have a notation. OK, so this is a curly d,</span>\
  \ <span m='2377000'>and it is not a straight d, and it is not a delta.</span> <span\
  \ m='2381000'>It's a d that kind of curves backwards like that.</span> <span m='2384000'>And,\
  \ this symbol is partial. OK, so it's a special notation</span> <span m='2390000'>for\
  \ partial derivatives. And, essentially what it means</span> <span m='2394000'>is\
  \ we are going to do a derivative where we care about</span> <span m='2396000'>only\
  \ one variable at a time. That's why it's partial.</span> <span m='2399000'>It's\
  \ missing the other variables.</span> <span m='2402000'>So, a function of several\
  \ variables doesn't have the usual</span> <span m='2406000'>derivative. It has only\
  \ partial derivatives</span> <span m='2410000'>for each variable. So, the partial\
  \ derivative,</span> <span m='2415000'>the partial f partial x at (x0, y0) is defined\
  \ to be the limit</span> <span m='2423000'>when I take a small change in x, delta\
  \ x,</span> <span m='2429000'>of the change in f -- -- divided by delta x.</span>\
  \ <span m='2443000'>OK, so here I'm actually not changing y at all.</span> <span\
  \ m='2447000'>I'm just changing x and looking at the rate of change with</span>\
  \ <span m='2451000'>respect to x. And, I have the same with</span> <span m='2454000'>respect\
  \ to y. Partial f partial y is the</span> <span m='2458000'>limit, so I should say,\
  \ at a point x0 y0 is the limit</span> <span m='2464000'>as delta y turns to zero.\
  \ So, this time I keep x the</span> <span m='2473000'>same, but I change y. OK,\
  \ so that's the definition of</span> <span m='2481000'>a partial derivative. And,\
  \ we say that a function is</span> <span m='2486000'>differentiable if these things\
  \ exist.</span> <span m='2489000'>OK, so most of the functions we'll see are differentiable.</span>\
  \ <span m='2491000'>And, we'll actually learn how to compute their partial</span>\
  \ <span m='2494000'>derivatives without having to do this because we'll just have\
  \ the</span> <span m='2498000'>usual methods for computing derivatives.</span> <span\
  \ m='2501000'>So, in fact, I claim you already know how to</span> <span m='2506000'>take\
  \ partial derivatives. So, let's see what it means</span> <span m='2509000'>geometrically.</span>\
  \ <span m='2520000'>So, geometrically, my function can be represented</span> <span\
  \ m='2527000'>by this graph, and I fix some point,</span> <span m='2532000'>(x0,\
  \ y0). And then, I'm going to ask</span> <span m='2538000'>myself what happens if\
  \ I change the value of,</span> <span m='2544000'>well, x, keeping y constant. So,\
  \ if I keep y constant and</span> <span m='2550000'>change x, it means that I'm\
  \ moving forwards or backwards</span> <span m='2553000'>parallel to the x axis.\
  \ So, that determines for me the</span> <span m='2558000'>vertical plane parallel\
  \ to the x, z plane when I fix y equals</span> <span m='2566000'>constant. And now,\
  \ if I slice the graph</span> <span m='2571000'>by that, I will get some curve that\
  \ goes, it's a slice of the</span> <span m='2579000'>graph of f. And now, what I\
  \ want to find is</span> <span m='2583000'>how f depends on x if I keep y constant.</span>\
  \ <span m='2586000'>That means it's the rate of change if I move along this</span>\
  \ <span m='2589000'>curve. So, in fact,</span> <span m='2591000'>if I look at the\
  \ slope of this thing.</span> <span m='2597000'>So, if I draw the tangent line to\
  \ this slice,</span> <span m='2602000'>then the slope will be partial f of partial\
  \ x.</span> <span m='2608000'>I think I have a better picture of that somewhere.</span>\
  \ <span m='2612000'>Yes, here it is. OK, that's the same picture,</span> <span m='2620000'>just\
  \ with different colors. So, I take the graph.</span> <span m='2623000'>I slice\
  \ it by a vertical plane. I get the curve,</span> <span m='2626000'>and now I take\
  \ the slope of that curve, and that gives me</span> <span m='2630000'>the partial\
  \ derivative. And, to finish,</span> <span m='2634000'>let me just tell you how,\
  \ and I should say,</span> <span m='2639000'>partial f partial y is the same thing\
  \ but slicing now by your</span> <span m='2642000'>plane that goes in the y, z directions.</span>\
  \ <span m='2645000'>OK, so I fix x equals constant. That means that I slice by a</span>\
  \ <span m='2651000'>plane that's parallel to the blackboard.</span> <span m='2653000'>I\
  \ get a curve, and I looked at the slope of</span> <span m='2657000'>that curve.\
  \ OK, so it's just a matter of</span> <span m='2660000'>formatting one variable,\
  \ setting it constant,</span> <span m='2663000'>and looking at the other one. So,\
  \ how to compute these</span> <span m='2667000'>things, well, we actually,</span>\
  \ <span m='2669000'>to find, well, there's a piece of notation I</span> <span m='2673000'>haven't\
  \ told you yet. So, another notation you will</span> <span m='2678000'>see, I think\
  \ this is what one uses a lot in physics.</span> <span m='2682000'>And, this is\
  \ what one uses a lot in applied math,</span> <span m='2685000'>which is the same\
  \ thing as physics but with different</span> <span m='2687000'>notations. OK, so\
  \ it just too different</span> <span m='2690000'>notations: partial f partial x,\
  \ or f subscript x.</span> <span m='2694000'>And, they are the same thing. Well,\
  \ we just treat y as a</span> <span m='2701000'>constant, and x as a variable. And,\
  \ vice versa if we want to</span> <span m='2710000'>find partial with aspect to\
  \ y. So, let me just finish with one</span> <span m='2716000'>quick example. Let's\
  \ say that they give you f</span> <span m='2722000'>of x, y equals x^3y y^2, then\
  \ partial f partial x.</span> <span m='2728000'>Well, let's take the derivative.\
  \ So, here it's x^3 times a</span> <span m='2732000'>constant. Derivative of x^3\
  \ is 3x^2 times</span> <span m='2737000'>the constant plus what's the derivative\
  \ of y^2?</span> <span m='2742000'>Zero, because it's a constant. If you do, instead,</span>\
  \ <span m='2745000'>partial f partial y, then this is actually a</span> <span m='2748000'>constant\
  \ times y. The derivative of y is one.</span> <span m='2751000'>So, that's just\
  \ x^3. And, the derivative of y^2 is</span> <span m='2757000'>2y. OK, so it's fairly\
  \ easy.</span> <span m='2759000'>You just have to keep remembering which one is\
  \ a</span> <span m='2762000'>variable, and which one isn't. OK, so more about this\
  \ next</span> <span m='2766000'>time, and we will also learn about maxima and minima\
  \ in</span> <span m='2770000'>several variables.</span> </p>"
