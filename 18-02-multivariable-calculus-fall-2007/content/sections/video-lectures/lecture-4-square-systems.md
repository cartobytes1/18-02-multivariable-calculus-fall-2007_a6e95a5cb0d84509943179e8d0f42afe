  of planes,</span> <span m=''30000''>and how they relate to linear systems and matrices
  as we have</span> <span m=''39000''>seen during Tuesday''s lecture. So, let''s start
  again with</span> <span m=''49000''>equations of planes. Remember, we''ve seen briefly</span>
  <span m=''57000''>that an equation for a plane is of the form ax by cz = d,</span>
  <span m=''68000''>where a, b, c, and d are just numbers.</span> <span m=''76000''>This
  expresses the condition for a point at coordinates x,</span> <span m=''81000''>y,
  z, to be in the plane. An equation of this form</span> <span m=''89000''>defines
  a plane. Let''s see how that works, again.</span> <span m=''98000''>Let''s start
  with an example. Let''s say that we want to find</span> <span m=''105000''>the equation
  of a plane through the origin with normal vector --</span> <span m=''116000''>--
  let''s say vector N equals the vector <1,5,</span> <span m=''124000''>10>. How do
  we find an equation of</span> <span m=''129000''>this plane? Remember that we can
  get an</span> <span m=''136000''>equation by thinking geometrically.</span> <span
  m=''143000''>So, what''s our thinking going to be?</span> <span m=''147000''>Well,
  we have the x, y, z axes. And, we have this vector N:</span> <span m=''161000''>.
  It''s supposed to be</span> <span m=''166000''>perpendicular to our plane. And,
  our plane passes through</span> <span m=''169000''>the origin here. So, we want
  to think of the</span> <span m=''174000''>plane that''s perpendicular to this vector.</span>
  <span m=''180000''>Well, when is a point in that plane?</span> <span m=''183000''>Let''s
  say we have a point, P -- -- at coordinates x,</span> <span m=''191000''>y, z. Well,
  the condition for P to be</span> <span m=''195000''>in the plane should be that
  we have a right angle here.</span> <span m=''200000''>OK, so P is in the plane whenever
  OP dot N is 0.</span> <span m=''214000''>And, if we write that explicitly, the vector
  OP has</span> <span m=''218000''>components x, y, z;</span> <span m=''220000''>N
  has components 1,5, 10. So that will give us x 5y 10z =</span> <span m=''228000''>0.
  That''s the equation of our</span> <span m=''235000''>plane. Now, let''s think about
  a</span> <span m=''240000''>slightly different problem. So, let''s do another problem.</span>
  <span m=''244000''>Let''s try to find the equation of the plane through the point</span>
  <span m=''251000''>P0 with coordinates, say, (2,1,-1),</span> <span m=''257000''>with
  normal vector, again, the same N = <1,5,</span> <span m=''266000''>10>. How do we
  find an equation of</span> <span m=''274000''>this thing? Well, we''re going to
  use the</span> <span m=''279000''>same method. In fact, let''s think for a</span>
  <span m=''284000''>second. I said we have our normal</span> <span m=''287000''>vector,
  N, and it''s going to be perpendicular to both planes at</span> <span m=''292000''>the
  same time. So, in fact,</span> <span m=''293000''>our two planes will be parallel
  to each other.</span> <span m=''296000''>The difference is, well, before,</span>
  <span m=''298000''>we had a plane that was perpendicular to N,</span> <span m=''300000''>and
  passing through the origin. And now, we have a new plane</span> <span m=''305000''>that''s
  going to pass not through the origin but through this</span> <span m=''310000''>point,
  P0. I don''t really know where it</span> <span m=''313000''>is, but let''s say,
  for example,</span> <span m=''315000''>that P0 is here. Then, I will just have to
  shift</span> <span m=''321000''>my plane so that, instead of passing through the</span>
  <span m=''326000''>origin, it passes through this new point.</span> <span m=''332000''>How
  am I going to do that? Well, now, for a point P to be</span> <span m=''336000''>in
  our new plane, we need the vector no longer OP</span> <span m=''341000''>but P0P
  to be perpendicular to N.</span> <span m=''344000''>So P is in this new plane if
  the vector P0P is perpendicular</span> <span m=''357000''>to N. And now, let''s
  think,</span> <span m=''361000''>what''s the vector P0P? Well, we take the coordinates</span>
  <span m=''365000''>of P, and we subtract those of P0.</span> <span m=''368000''>So,
  that should be x-2, y-1, and z 1,</span> <span m=''375000''>dot product with <1,5,
  10> equals 0.</span> <span m=''383000''>Let''s expand this. We get (x-2) 5(y-1)
  10(z 1) = 0.</span> <span m=''401000''>Let''s put the constants on the other side.</span>
  <span m=''405000''>We get: x 5y 10z equals -- here minus two becomes two,</span>
  <span m=''410000''>minus five becomes five, ten becomes minus ten.</span> <span
  m=''416000''>I think we end up with negative three.</span> <span m=''421000''>So,
  the only thing that changes between these two equations is</span> <span m=''425000''>the
  constant term on the right-hand side,</span> <span m=''427000''>the thing that I
  called d. The other common feature is</span> <span m=''431000''>that the coefficients
  of x, y, and z: one,</span> <span m=''433000''>five, and ten, correspond exactly
  to the</span> <span m=''435000''>normal vector. That''s something you should</span>
  <span m=''439000''>remember about planes. These coefficients here</span> <span m=''442000''>correspond
  exactly to a normal vector and, well,</span> <span m=''447000''>this constant term
  here roughly measures how far you move</span> <span m=''453000''>from... I f you
  have a plane through</span> <span m=''455000''>the origin, the right-hand side will
  be zero.</span> <span m=''457000''>And, if you move to a parallel plane, then this
  number will</span> <span m=''461000''>become something else. Actually, how could
  we have</span> <span m=''464000''>found that -3 more quickly? Well, we know that
  the first</span> <span m=''468000''>part of the equation is like this.</span> <span
  m=''471000''>And we know something else. We know that the point P0 is in</span>
  <span m=''475000''>the plane. So, if we plug the coordinates</span> <span m=''480000''>of
  P0 into this, well, x is 2 5 times 1 10 times</span> <span m=''485000''>-1. We get
  -3.</span> <span m=''488000''>So, in fact, the number we should have here</span>
  <span m=''492000''>should be minus three so that P0 is a solution.</span> <span
  m=''496000''>Let me point out -- (I''ll put a 1 here again) -- these three</span>
  <span m=''505000''>numbers: 1,5, 10, are exactly the normal</span> <span m=''511000''>vector.
  And one way that we can get</span> <span m=''517000''>this number here is by computing
  the value of the left-hand side</span> <span m=''525000''>at the point P0. We plug
  in the point P0 into</span> <span m=''531000''>the left hand side. OK, any questions
  about that?</span> <span m=''547000''>By the way, of course, a plane doesn''t have
  just one</span> <span m=''550000''>equation. It has infinitely many</span> <span
  m=''552000''>equations because if instead, say, I multiply everything by</span>
  <span m=''558000''>two, 2x 10y 20z = -6 is also an equation for this plane.</span>
  <span m=''563000''>That''s because we have normal vectors of all sizes -- we can</span>
  <span m=''572000''>choose how big we make it. Again, the single most</span> <span
  m=''580000''>important thing here: in the equation ax by cz = d,</span> <span m=''589000''>the
  coefficients, a, b, c, give us a normal</span> <span m=''597000''>vector to the
  plane. So, that''s why,</span> <span m=''603000''>in fact, what matters to us the
  most is finding the normal</span> <span m=''607000''>vector. In particular,</span>
  <span m=''608000''>if you remember, last time I explained something</span> <span
  m=''611000''>about how we can find a normal vector to a plane if we know</span>
  <span m=''614000''>points in the plane. Namely, we can take the cross</span> <span
  m=''617000''>product of two vectors contained in the plane.</span> <span m=''648000''>Let''s
  just do an example to see if we completely understand</span> <span m=''654000''>what''s
  going on. Let''s say that I give you the</span> <span m=''659000''>vector with components
  ,</span> <span m=''663000''>and I give you the plane x y 3z = 5.</span> <span m=''668000''>So,
  do you think that this vector is parallel to the plane,</span> <span m=''672000''>perpendicular
  to it, neither?</span> <span m=''684000''>I''m starting to see a few votes. OK,
  I see that most of you are</span> <span m=''703000''>answering number two: this
  vector is perpendicular to</span> <span m=''708000''>the plane. There are some other
  answers</span> <span m=''711000''>too. Well, let''s try to figure it</span> <span
  m=''719000''>out. Let''s do the example.</span> <span m=''722000''>Say v is <1,2,
  -1> and the plane is x y 3z</span> <span m=''732000''>= 5. Let''s just draw that
  plane</span> <span m=''735000''>anywhere -- it doesn''t really matter.</span> <span
  m=''738000''>Let''s first get a normal vector out of it.</span> <span m=''741000''>Well,
  to get a normal vector to the plane, what I will do is</span> <span m=''748000''>take
  the coefficients of x, y, and z.</span> <span m=''753000''>So, that''s . So</span>
  <span m=''756000''>is perpendicular to the plane. How do we get all the other</span>
  <span m=''760000''>vectors that are perpendicular to the plane?</span> <span m=''763000''>Well,
  all the perpendicular vectors are parallel to each</span> <span m=''767000''>other.
  That means that they are just</span> <span m=''770000''>obtained by multiplying
  this guy by some number.</span> <span m=''775000''>for example, would still be perpendicular
  to</span> <span m=''779000''>the plane.</span> <span m=''781000''>is also perpendicular
  to the plane.</span> <span m=''784000''>But now, see, these guys are not proportional</span>
  <span m=''787000''>to each other. So, V is not perpendicular to</span> <span m=''798000''>the
  plane. So it''s not perpendicular to</span> <span m=''808000''>the plane. Being
  perpendicular to the</span> <span m=''813000''>plane is the same as being parallel
  to its normal vector.</span> <span m=''817000''>Now, what about testing if v is,
  instead, parallel to the</span> <span m=''821000''>plane? Well, it''s parallel to
  the</span> <span m=''823000''>plane if it''s perpendicular to N.</span> <span m=''826000''>Let''s
  check.</span> <span m=''836000''>So, let''s try to see if v is perpendicular to
  N.</span> <span m=''844000''>Well, let''s do v.N. That''s <1,2,</span> <span m=''851000''>-
  1> dot <1,1, 3>.</span> <span m=''855000''>You get 1 2 - 3=0. So, yes.</span> <span
  m=''865000''>If it''s perpendicular to N, it means -- It''s actually going</span>
  <span m=''877000''>to be parallel to the plane.</span> <span m=''896000''>OK, any
  questions? Yes?</span> <span m=''900000''>[QUESTION FROM STUDENT:] When you plug
  the vector into</span> <span m=''903000''>the plane equation, you get zero.</span>
  <span m=''905000''>What does that mean? Let''s see.</span> <span m=''913000''>If
  I plug the vector into the plane equation:</span> <span m=''918000''>1 2-3, well,
  the left hand side becomes</span> <span m=''923000''>zero. So, it''s not a solution
  of the</span> <span m=''930000''>plane equation. There''s two different things</span>
  <span m=''934000''>here. One is that the point with</span> <span m=''938000''>coordinates
  (1,2,- 1) is not in the plane.</span> <span m=''944000''>What that tells us is that,
  if I put my vector V at the</span> <span m=''952000''>origin, then its head is not
  going to be in the plane.</span> <span m=''961000''>On the other hand, you''re right,</span>
  <span m=''963000''>the left hand side evaluates to zero.</span> <span m=''966000''>What
  that means is that, if instead I had taken the</span> <span m=''969000''>plane x
  y 3z = 0, then it would be inside.</span> <span m=''972000''>The plane is x y 3z
  = 5, so x y 3z = 0 would be a plane</span> <span m=''981000''>parallel to it, but
  through the origin.</span> <span m=''987000''>So, that would be another way to see
  that the vector is</span> <span m=''990000''>parallel to the plane. If we move the
  plane to a</span> <span m=''993000''>parallel plane through the origin, then the
  endpoint of the</span> <span m=''997000''>vector is in the plane. OK, that''s another
  way to</span> <span m=''1004000''>convince ourselves. Any other questions?</span>
  <span m=''1016000''>OK, let''s move on. So, last time we learned about</span> <span
  m=''1024000''>matrices and linear systems. So, let''s try to think,</span> <span
  m=''1028000''>now, about linear systems in terms of equations of planes and</span>
  <span m=''1032000''>intersections of planes. Remember that a linear system</span>
  <span m=''1035000''>is a bunch of equations -- say, a 3x3 linear system is three</span>
  <span m=''1039000''>different equations. Each of them is the equation of</span>
  <span m=''1043000''>a plane. So, in fact,</span> <span m=''1045000''>if we try to
  solve a system of equations, that means actually</span> <span m=''1049000''>we are
  trying to find a point that is on several planes at the</span> <span m=''1053000''>same
  time. So...</span> <span m=''1066000''>Let''s say that we have a 3x3 linear system.</span>
  <span m=''1072000''>Just to take an example -- it doesn''t really matter what I</span>
  <span m=''1084000''>give you, but let''s say I give you x z = 1, x y = 2,</span>
  <span m=''1094000''>x 2y 3z = 3. What does it mean to solve this?</span> <span m=''1101000''>It
  means we want to find x, y, z which satisfy all of these</span> <span m=''1107000''>conditions.
  Let''s just look at the first</span> <span m=''1110000''>equation, first. Well,
  the first equation says</span> <span m=''1113000''>our point should be on the plane
  which has this equation.</span> <span m=''1117000''>Then, the second equation says
  that our point should also be on</span> <span m=''1122000''>that plane. So, if you
  just look at the</span> <span m=''1126000''>first two equations, you have two planes.</span>
  <span m=''1130000''>And the solutions -- these two equations determine for you two</span>
  <span m=''1148000''>planes, and two planes intersect in a line.</span> <span m=''1162000''>Now,
  what happens with the third equation?</span> <span m=''1167000''>That''s actually
  going to be a third plane.</span> <span m=''1170000''>So, if we want to solve the
  first two equations,</span> <span m=''1173000''>we have to be on this line. And
  if we want to solve the</span> <span m=''1177000''>third one, we also need to be
  on another plane.</span> <span m=''1181000''>And, in general, the three planes intersect
  in a</span> <span m=''1192000''>point because this line of intersection...</span>
  <span m=''1202000''>Three planes intersect in a point,</span> <span m=''1204000''>and
  one way to think about it is that the line where the first</span> <span m=''1209000''>two
  planes intersect meets the third plane in a point.</span> <span m=''1214000''>And,
  that point is the solution to the linear system.</span> <span m=''1221000''>The
  line -- this is mathematical notation for the</span> <span m=''1228000''>intersection
  between the first two planes -- intersects the</span> <span m=''1236000''>third
  plane in a point, which is going to be the</span> <span m=''1246000''>solution.
  So, how do we find the solution?</span> <span m=''1253000''>One way is to draw pictures
  and try to figure out where the</span> <span m=''1258000''>solution is, but that''s
  not how we do it in practice if we are</span> <span m=''1263000''>given the equations.
  Let me use matrix notation.</span> <span m=''1267000''>Remember, we saw on Tuesday
  that the solution to AX = B is</span> <span m=''1277000''>given by X = A inverse
  B. We got from here to there by</span> <span m=''1283000''>multiplying on the left
  by A inverse.</span> <span m=''1286000''>A inverse AX simplifies to X equals A inverse
  B.</span> <span m=''1292000''>And, once again, it''s A inverse B and not BA</span>
  <span m=''1295000''>inverse. If you try to set up the</span> <span m=''1297000''>multiplication,
  BA inverse doesn''t work.</span> <span m=''1299000''>The sizes are not compatible,
  you can''t multiply the other</span> <span m=''1307000''>way around. OK, that''s
  pretty good --</span> <span m=''1314000''>unless it doesn''t work that way. What
  could go wrong?</span> <span m=''1323000''>Well, let''s say that our first two planes
  do intersect nicely</span> <span m=''1327000''>in a line, but let''s think about
  the third plane.</span> <span m=''1330000''>Maybe the third plane does not intersect
  that line nicely in a</span> <span m=''1333000''>point. Maybe it''s actually parallel
  to</span> <span m=''1339000''>that line. Let''s try to think about this</span> <span
  m=''1346000''>question for a second. Let''s say that the set of</span> <span m=''1353000''>solutions
  to a 3x3 linear system is not just one point.</span> <span m=''1359000''>So, we
  don''t have a unique solution that we can get this</span> <span m=''1363000''>way.
  What do you think could happen?</span> <span m=''1373000''>OK, I see that answers
  number three and five seem to be</span> <span m=''1378000''>dominating. There''s
  also a bit of answer</span> <span m=''1383000''>number one. In fact, these are pretty
  good</span> <span m=''1386000''>answers. I see that some of you figured</span> <span
  m=''1388000''>out that you can answer one and three at the same time,</span> <span
  m=''1392000''>or three and five at the same time.</span> <span m=''1395000''>I yet
  have to see somebody with three hands answer all three</span> <span m=''1398000''>numbers
  at the same time. OK.</span> <span m=''1400000''>Indeed, we''ll see very soon that
  we could have either no</span> <span m=''1406000''>solution, a line, or a plane.</span>
  <span m=''1409000''>The other answers: "two points"</span> <span m=''1413000''>(two
  solutions), we will see,</span> <span m=''1415000''>is actually not a possibility
  because if you have two</span> <span m=''1417000''>different solutions, then the
  entire line through</span> <span m=''1420000''>these two points is also going to
  be made of solutions.</span> <span m=''1424000''>"A tetrahedron" is just there to
  amuse you,</span> <span m=''1427000''>it''s actually not a good answer to the question.</span>
  <span m=''1431000''>It''s not very likely that you will get a tetrahedron out of</span>
  <span m=''1434000''>intersecting planes. "A plane"</span> <span m=''1436000''>is
  indeed possible, and "I don''t know"</span> <span m=''1438000''>is still OK for
  a few more minutes,</span> <span m=''1440000''>but we''re going to get to the bottom
  of this,</span> <span m=''1444000''>and then we will know. OK, let''s try to figure
  out</span> <span m=''1449000''>what can happen. Let me go back to my picture.</span>
  <span m=''1456000''>I had my first two planes; they determine a line.</span> <span
  m=''1460000''>And now I have my third plane. Maybe my third plane is</span> <span
  m=''1463000''>actually parallel to the line but doesn''t pass through it.</span>
  <span m=''1469000''>Well, then, there''s no solutions because,</span> <span m=''1472000''>to
  solve the system of equations, I need to be in the</span> <span m=''1477000''>first
  two planes. So, that means I need to be in</span> <span m=''1480000''>that vertical
  line. (That line was supposed to be</span> <span m=''1483000''>red, but I guess
  it doesn''t really show up as red).</span> <span m=''1487000''>And it also needs
  to be in the third plane.</span> <span m=''1489000''>But the line and the plane
  are parallel to each other.</span> <span m=''1492000''>There''s just no place where
  they intersect.</span> <span m=''1495000''>So there''s no way to solve all the equations.</span>
  <span m=''1499000''>On the other hand, the other thing that could</span> <span m=''1503000''>happen
  is that actually the line is contained in the plane.</span> <span m=''1507000''>And
  then, any point on that line will automatically solve</span> <span m=''1513000''>the
  third equation. So if you try solving a system</span> <span m=''1519000''>that looks
  like this by hand, if you do substitutions,</span> <span m=''1523000''>eliminations,
  and so on,</span> <span m=''1525000''>what you will notice is that, after you have
  dealt with two</span> <span m=''1528000''>of the equations, the third one would
  actually</span> <span m=''1531000''>turn out to be the same as what you got out
  of the first two.</span> <span m=''1535000''>It doesn''t give you any additional
  information.</span> <span m=''1536000''>It''s as if you had only two equations.</span>
  <span m=''1541000''>The previous case would be when actually the third equation</span>
  <span m=''1545000''>contradicts something that you can get out of the first two.</span>
  <span m=''1549000''>For example, maybe out of the first two,</span> <span m=''1551000''>you
  got that x plus z equals one, and the third equation is x</span> <span m=''1554000''>plus
  z equals two. Well, it can''t be one and two</span> <span m=''1557000''>at the same
  time. Another way to say it is that</span> <span m=''1560000''>this picture is one
  where you can get out of the equations</span> <span m=''1564000''>that a number
  equals a different number.</span> <span m=''1567000''>That''s impossible. And, that
  picture is one where</span> <span m=''1570000''>out of the equations you get zero
  equals zero,</span> <span m=''1572000''>which is certainly true, but isn''t a very
  useful</span> <span m=''1575000''>equation. So, you can''t actually finish</span>
  <span m=''1579000''>solving. OK, let me write that down.</span> <span m=''1587000''>unless
  the third plane is parallel to the line where P1</span> <span m=''1608000''>and
  P2 intersect. Then there''s two subcases.</span> <span m=''1618000''>If the line
  of intersections of P1 and P2 is actually contained</span> <span m=''1631000''>in
  P3 (the third plane), then we have infinitely many</span> <span m=''1642000''>solutions.
  Namely, any point on the line</span> <span m=''1646000''>will automatically solve
  the third equation.</span> <span m=''1669000''>The other subcase is if the line
  of the intersection of P1</span> <span m=''1685000''>and P2 is parallel to P3 and
  not contained in it.</span> <span m=''1699000''>Then we get no solutions. Just to
  show you the pictures</span> <span m=''1715000''>once again: when we have the first
  two planes,</span> <span m=''1718000''>they give us a line. And now, depending on
  what</span> <span m=''1722000''>happens to that line in relation to the third plane,</span>
  <span m=''1725000''>various situations can happen. If the line hits the third</span>
  <span m=''1730000''>plane in a point, then that''s going to be our</span> <span
  m=''1735000''>solution. If that line,</span> <span m=''1738000''>instead, is parallel
  to the third plane, well,</span> <span m=''1741000''>if it''s parallel and outside
  of it, then we have no solution.</span> <span m=''1745000''>If it''s parallel and
  contained in it, then we have infinitely</span> <span m=''1756000''>many solutions.
  So, going back to our list of</span> <span m=''1763000''>possibilities, let''s see
  what can happen.</span> <span m=''1769000''>No solution: we''ve seen that it happens
  when</span> <span m=''1772000''>the line where the first two planes intersect is
  parallel to</span> <span m=''1777000''>the third one. Two points: well,</span> <span
  m=''1780000''>that didn''t come up. As I said, the problem is that,</span> <span
  m=''1785000''>if the line of intersections of the first two planes has two</span>
  <span m=''1789000''>points that are in the third plane,</span> <span m=''1792000''>then
  that means the entire line must actually be in the third</span> <span m=''1795000''>plane.
  So, if you have two solutions,</span> <span m=''1798000''>then you have more than
  two. In fact, you have infinitely</span> <span m=''1803000''>many, and we''ve seen
  that can happen.</span> <span m=''1805000''>A tetrahedron: still doesn''t look very</span>
  <span m=''1810000''>promising. What about a plane?</span> <span m=''1813000''>Well,
  that''s a case that I didn''t explain because I''ve been</span> <span m=''1817000''>assuming
  that P1 and P2 are different planes and they</span> <span m=''1820000''>intersect
  in a line. But, in fact,</span> <span m=''1823000''>they could be parallel, in which
  case we already have</span> <span m=''1826000''>no solution to the first two equations;</span>
  <span m=''1828000''>or they could be the same plane. And now, if the third plane
  is</span> <span m=''1832000''>also the same plane -- if all three planes are the
  same plane,</span> <span m=''1836000''>then you have a plane of solutions.</span>
  <span m=''1838000''>If I give you three times the same equation,</span> <span m=''1840000''>that
  is a linear system. It''s not a very interesting</span> <span m=''1844000''>one,
  but it''s a linear system. And "I don''t know"</span> <span m=''1850000''>is no
  longer a solution either. OK, any questions?</span> <span m=''1858000''>[STUDENT
  QUESTION:] What''s the geometric</span> <span m=''1861000''>significance of the
  plane x y z equals 1, as opposed to 2,</span> <span m=''1864000''>or 3? That''s
  a very good question.</span> <span m=''1867000''>The question is, what is the geometric</span>
  <span m=''1870000''>significance of an equation like x y z equals to 1,2,</span>
  <span m=''1874000''>3, or something else? Well, if the equation is x y z</span>
  <span m=''1879000''>equals zero, it means that our plane is passing through the</span>
  <span m=''1883000''>origin. And then, if we change the</span> <span m=''1885000''>constant,
  it means we move to a parallel plane.</span> <span m=''1888000''>So, the first guess
  that you might have is that this number</span> <span m=''1891000''>on the right-hand
  side is the distance between the origin and</span> <span m=''1895000''>the plane.
  It tells us how far from the</span> <span m=''1897000''>origin we are. That is not
  quite true.</span> <span m=''1902000''>In fact, that would be true if the coefficients
  here formed a</span> <span m=''1907000''>unit vector. Then this would just be the</span>
  <span m=''1910000''>distance to the origin. Otherwise, you have to actually</span>
  <span m=''1915000''>scale by the length of this normal vector.</span> <span m=''1917000''>And,
  I think there''s a problem in the Notes that will show you</span> <span m=''1921000''>exactly
  how this works. You should think of it roughly</span> <span m=''1925000''>as how
  much we have moved the plane away from the origin.</span> <span m=''1929000''>That''s
  the meaning of the last term, D, in the right-hand side</span> <span m=''1933000''>of
  the equation.</span> <span m=''1949000''>So, let''s try to think about what exactly
  these cases are --</span> <span m=''1954000''>how do we detect in which situation
  we are?</span> <span m=''1958000''>It''s all very nice in the picture, but it''s
  difficult to</span> <span m=''1963000''>draw planes. In fact, when I draw these</span>
  <span m=''1966000''>pictures, I''m always very careful not to actually pretend</span>
  <span m=''1968000''>to draw an actual plane given by an equation.</span> <span m=''1971000''>When
  I do, then it''s blatantly false -- it''s difficult to draw</span> <span m=''1976000''>a
  plane correctly. So, instead,</span> <span m=''1978000''>let''s try to think about
  it in terms of matrices.</span> <span m=''1982000''>In particular, what''s wrong
  with this?</span> <span m=''1984000''>Why can''t we always say the solution is X
  = A inverse B?</span> <span m=''1989000''>Well, the point is that, actually, you
  cannot always</span> <span m=''1999000''>invert a matrix. Recall we''ve seen this
  formula:</span> <span m=''2006000''>A inverse is one over determinant of A times
  the</span> <span m=''2012000''>adjoint matrix. And we''ve learned how to</span>
  <span m=''2016000''>compute this thing: remember, we had to take</span> <span m=''2019000''>minors,
  then flip some signs, and then transpose.</span> <span m=''2023000''>That step we
  can always do. We can always do these</span> <span m=''2026000''>calculations. But
  then, at the end,</span> <span m=''2028000''>we have to divide by the determinant.</span>
  <span m=''2031000''>That''s fine if the determinant is not zero.</span> <span m=''2033000''>But,
  if the determinant is zero, then certainly we cannot</span> <span m=''2040000''>do
  that. What I didn''t mention last time</span> <span m=''2045000''>is that the matrix
  is invertible -- that means it has an inverse</span> <span m=''2051000''>-- exactly
  when its determinant is not zero.</span> <span m=''2056000''>That''s something we
  should remember.</span> <span m=''2060000''>So, if the determinant is not zero,
  then we can use our method</span> <span m=''2064000''>to find the inverse. And then
  we can solve using</span> <span m=''2068000''>this method. If not, then not.</span>
  <span m=''2071000''>Yes? [STUDENT QUESTION:]</span> <span m=''2073000''>Sorry, can
  you reexplain that? You can invert A if the</span> <span m=''2076000''>determinant
  of A is not equal to zero?</span> <span m=''2078000''>That''s correct. We can invert
  the matrix A if</span> <span m=''2081000''>the determinant is not zero. If you look
  again at the method</span> <span m=''2086000''>that we saw last time: first we had
  to compute the</span> <span m=''2089000''>adjoint matrix. And, these are operations
  we</span> <span m=''2092000''>can always do. If we are given a 3x3 matrix,</span>
  <span m=''2094000''>we can always compute the adjoint.</span> <span m=''2096000''>And
  then, the last step to find the inverse was to divide by the</span> <span m=''2099000''>determinant.
  And that we can only do if the</span> <span m=''2102000''>determinant is not zero.
  So, if we have a matrix whose</span> <span m=''2106000''>determinant is not zero,
  then we know how to find the</span> <span m=''2109000''>inverse. If the determinant
  is zero,</span> <span m=''2111000''>then of course this method doesn''t work.</span>
  <span m=''2114000''>I''m actually saying even more: there isn''t an inverse at all.</span>
  <span m=''2117000''>It''s not just that our method fails.</span> <span m=''2119000''>I
  cannot take the inverse of a matrix with determinant zero.</span> <span m=''2127000''>Geometrically,
  the situation where the</span> <span m=''2130000''>determinant is not zero is exactly
  this nice usual</span> <span m=''2134000''>situation where the three planes intersect
  in a point,</span> <span m=''2139000''>while the situation where the determinant
  is zero is this</span> <span m=''2145000''>situation here where the line determined
  by the first two</span> <span m=''2152000''>planes is parallel to the third plane.</span>
  <span m=''2156000''>Let me emphasize this again, and let''s see again what</span>
  <span m=''2166000''>happens. Let''s start with an easier case.</span> <span m=''2179000''>It''s
  called the case of a homogeneous system.</span> <span m=''2181000''>It''s called
  homogeneous because it''s the situation where the</span> <span m=''2187000''>equations
  are invariant under scaling.</span> <span m=''2191000''>So, a homogeneous system
  is one where the right hand side is</span> <span m=''2195000''>zero -- there''s
  no B. If you want,</span> <span m=''2198000''>the constant terms here are all zero:
  0,0, 0.</span> <span m=''2202000''>OK, so this one is not homogenous.</span> <span
  m=''2206000''>So, let''s see what happens there.</span> <span m=''2217000''>Let''s
  take an example. Instead of this system,</span> <span m=''2222000''>we could take
  x z = 0, x y = 0, and x 2y 3z also</span> <span m=''2230000''>equals zero. Can we
  solve these equations?</span> <span m=''2236000''>I think actually you already know
  a very simple solution to</span> <span m=''2240000''>these equations. Yeah, you
  can just take x,</span> <span m=''2243000''>y, and z all to be zero. So, there''s
  always an obvious</span> <span m=''2254000''>solution -- -- namely, (0,0, 0).</span>
  <span m=''2264000''>And, in mathematical jargon, this is called the trivial</span>
  <span m=''2273000''>solution. There''s always this trivial</span> <span m=''2277000''>solution.
  What''s the geometric</span> <span m=''2279000''>interpretation? Well, having zeros
  here means</span> <span m=''2281000''>that all three planes pass through the origin.</span>
  <span m=''2284000''>So, certainly the origin is always a solution.</span> <span
  m=''2301000''>The origin is always a solution because the three planes -- --</span>
  <span m=''2315000''>pass through the origin. Now there''s two subcases.</span> <span
  m=''2325000''>One case is if the determinant of the matrix A is nonzero.</span>
  <span m=''2332000''>That means that we can invert A. So, if we can invert A,</span>
  <span m=''2341000''>then we can solve the system by multiplying by A inverse.</span>
  <span m=''2347000''>If we multiply by A inverse, we''ll get X equals A inverse</span>
  <span m=''2353000''>times zero, which is zero. That''s the only solution</span>
  <span m=''2361000''>because, if AX is zero,</span> <span m=''2364000''>then let''s
  multiply by A inverse: we get that A inverse</span> <span m=''2367000''>AX, which
  is X, equals A inverse zero,</span> <span m=''2369000''>which is zero. We get that
  X equals zero.</span> <span m=''2372000''>We''ve solved it, there''s no other solution.</span>
  <span m=''2382000''>To go back to these pictures that we all enjoy,</span> <span
  m=''2395000''>it''s this case. Now the other case,</span> <span m=''2403000''>if
  the determinant of A equals zero, then this method doesn''t</span> <span m=''2413000''>quite
  work. What does it mean that the</span> <span m=''2418000''>determinant of A is
  zero? Remember, the entries in A are</span> <span m=''2422000''>the coefficients
  in the equations.</span> <span m=''2425000''>But now, the coefficients in the equations
  are exactly the</span> <span m=''2429000''>normal vectors to the planes. So, that''s
  the same thing as</span> <span m=''2436000''>saying that the determinant of the
  three normal vectors to our</span> <span m=''2447000''>three planes is 0. That means
  that N1,</span> <span m=''2454000''>N2, and N3 are actually in a same plane -- they''re
  coplanar.</span> <span m=''2462000''>These three vectors are coplanar.</span> <span
  m=''2466000''>So, let''s see what happens. I claim it will correspond to</span>
  <span m=''2474000''>this situation here. Let''s draw the normal vectors</span> <span
  m=''2480000''>to these three planes. (Well, it''s not very easy to</span> <span
  m=''2487000''>see, but I''ve tried to draw the normal vectors to my planes.)</span>
  <span m=''2493000''>They are all in the direction that''s perpendicular to the line</span>
  <span m=''2497000''>of intersection. They are all in the same plane.</span> <span
  m=''2500000''>So, if I try to form a parallelepiped with these three</span> <span
  m=''2504000''>normal vectors, well, I will get something</span> <span m=''2507000''>that''s
  completely flat, and has no volume,</span> <span m=''2510000''>has volume zero.
  So the parallelepiped -- -- has</span> <span m=''2524000''>volume 0. And the fact
  that the normal</span> <span m=''2531000''>vectors are coplanar tells us that, in
  fact -- (well,</span> <span m=''2539000''>let me start a new blackboard). Let''s
  say that our normal</span> <span m=''2545000''>vectors, N1, N2, N3, are all in the
  same plane.</span> <span m=''2548000''>And let''s think about the direction that''s
  perpendicular</span> <span m=''2552000''>to N1, N2, and N3 at the same time.</span>
  <span m=''2555000''>I claim that it will be the line of intersection.</span> <span
  m=''2588000''>So, let me try to draw that picture again.</span> <span m=''2592000''>We
  have three planes -- (now you see why I prepared a picture</span> <span m=''2606000''>in
  advance. It''s easier to draw it</span> <span m=''2611000''>beforehand). And I said
  their normal vectors</span> <span m=''2617000''>are all in the same plane. What
  else do I know?</span> <span m=''2621000''>I know that all these planes pass through
  the origin.</span> <span m=''2625000''>So the origin is somewhere in the intersection
  of the three</span> <span m=''2630000''>planes. Now, I said that the normal</span>
  <span m=''2639000''>vectors to my three planes are all actually coplanar.</span>
  <span m=''2653000''>So N1, N2, N3 determine a plane. Now, if I look at the line</span>
  <span m=''2663000''>through the origin that''s perpendicular to N1,</span> <span
  m=''2667000''>N2, and N3, so, perpendicular to this red</span> <span m=''2673000''>plane
  here, it''s supposed to be in all the</span> <span m=''2679000''>planes. (You can
  see that better on the</span> <span m=''2684000''>side screens). And why is that?</span>
  <span m=''2687000''>Well, that''s because my line is perpendicular to the normal</span>
  <span m=''2691000''>vectors, so it''s parallel to the planes.</span> <span m=''2694000''>It''s
  parallel to all the planes. Now, why is it in the planes</span> <span m=''2698000''>instead
  of parallel to them? Well, that''s because my line</span> <span m=''2701000''>goes
  through the origin, and the origin is on the</span> <span m=''2703000''>planes.
  So, certainly my line has to be</span> <span m=''2707000''>contained in the planes,
  not parallel to them.</span> <span m=''2711000''>So the line through the origin
  and perpendicular to the plane</span> <span m=''2726000''>of N1, N2, N3 -- -- is
  parallel to all three planes.</span> <span m=''2739000''>And, because the planes
  go through the origin,</span> <span m=''2747000''>it''s contained in them. So what
  happens here is I have,</span> <span m=''2758000''>in fact, infinitely many solutions.</span>
  <span m=''2766000''>How do I find these solutions? Well, if I want to find</span>
  <span m=''2769000''>something that''s perpendicular to N1, N2, and N3 -- if I just</span>
  <span m=''2773000''>want to be perpendicular to N1 and N2,</span> <span m=''2776000''>I
  can take their cross product. So, for example,</span> <span m=''2789000''>N1 cross
  N2 is perpendicular to N1 and to N2,</span> <span m=''2798000''>and also to N3,
  because N3 is in the same plane</span> <span m=''2803000''>as N1 and N2, so, if
  you''re perpendicular to</span> <span m=''2806000''>N1 and N2, you are also perpendicular
  to N3.</span> <span m=''2809000''>It''s automatic. So, it''s a nontrivial solution.</span>
  <span m=''2823000''>This vector goes along the line of intersections.</span> <span
  m=''2829000''>OK, that''s the case of homogeneous systems.</span> <span m=''2833000''>And
  then, let''s finish with the other case, the general case.</span> <span m=''2844000''>If
  we look at a system, AX = B, with B now anything,</span> <span m=''2852000''>there''s
  two cases. If the determinant of A is not</span> <span m=''2861000''>zero, then
  there is a unique solution -- -- namely,</span> <span m=''2871000''>X equals A inverse
  B. If the determinant of A is</span> <span m=''2879000''>zero, then it means we
  have the</span> <span m=''2882000''>situation with planes that are all parallel
  to a same line,</span> <span m=''2886000''>and then we have either no solution or
  infinitely many</span> <span m=''2898000''>solutions. It cannot be a single solution.</span>
  <span m=''2903000''>Now, whether you have no solutions or infinitely many</span>
  <span m=''2906000''>solutions, we haven''t actually developed the tools to answer</span>
  <span m=''2910000''>that. But, if you try solving the</span> <span m=''2912000''>system
  by hand, by elimination,</span> <span m=''2914000''>you will see that you end up
  maybe with something that says</span> <span m=''2917000''>zero equals zero, and
  you have infinitely many</span> <span m=''2920000''>solutions. Actually, if you
  can find one</span> <span m=''2922000''>solution, then you know that there''s infinitely
  many.</span> <span m=''2925000''>On the other hand, if you end up with something</span>
  <span m=''2928000''>that''s a contradiction, like one equals two,</span> <span m=''2931000''>then
  you know there''s no solutions.</span> <span m=''2934000''>That''s the end for today.
  Tomorrow, we will learn about</span> <span m=''2938000''>parametric equations for
  lines and curves.</span> </p>'
