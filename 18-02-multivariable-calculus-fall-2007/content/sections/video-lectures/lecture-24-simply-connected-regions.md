  at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m=''23000''>And, well let''s see. So, before we actually
  start</span> <span m=''25000''>reviewing for the test, I still have to tell you
  a few</span> <span m=''30000''>small things because I promised to say a few words
  about what''s</span> <span m=''34000''>the difference, or precisely,</span> <span
  m=''37000''>what''s the difference between curl being zero and a field</span> <span
  m=''41000''>being a gradient field, and why we have this assumption</span> <span
  m=''45000''>that our vector field had to be defined everywhere for a field</span>
  <span m=''49000''>with curl zero to actually be conservative for our test for</span>
  <span m=''53000''>gradient fields to be valid? So -- More about validity of</span>
  <span m=''64000''>Green''s theorem and things like that.</span> <span m=''77000''>So,
  we''ve seen the statement of Green''s theorem in two forms.</span> <span m=''89000''>Both
  of them have to do with comparing a line integral along</span> <span m=''93000''>a
  closed curve to a double integral over the region inside</span> <span m=''98000''>enclosed
  by the curve. So,</span> <span m=''101000''>one of them says the line integral for
  the work done by a</span> <span m=''105000''>vector field along a closed curve counterclockwise
  is equal</span> <span m=''110000''>to the double integral of a curl of a field over
  the enclosed</span> <span m=''114000''>region. And, the other one says the</span>
  <span m=''118000''>total flux out of the region, so, the flux through the curve</span>
  <span m=''125000''>is equal to the double integral of divergence of a field in the</span>
  <span m=''131000''>region. So, in both cases,</span> <span m=''133000''>we need
  the vector field to be defined not only,</span> <span m=''138000''>I mean, the left
  hand side makes sense if a vector field is</span> <span m=''141000''>just defined
  on the curve because it''s just a line</span> <span m=''144000''>integral on C.
  We don''t care what happens</span> <span m=''147000''>inside. But, for the right-hand
  side to</span> <span m=''149000''>make sense, and therefore for the equality</span>
  <span m=''151000''>to make sense, we need the vector field to be</span> <span m=''154000''>defined
  everywhere inside the region.</span> <span m=''158000''>So, I said, if there is
  a point somewhere in here where my</span> <span m=''161000''>vector field is not
  defined, then it doesn''t work.</span> <span m=''165000''>And actually, we''ve seen
  that example.</span> <span m=''173000''>So, this only works if F and its derivatives
  are defined</span> <span m=''188000''>everywhere in the region, R.</span> <span
  m=''197000''>Otherwise, we are in trouble. OK,</span> <span m=''200000''>so we''ve
  seen for example that if I gave you the vector field</span> <span m=''209000''>minus
  yi xj over x squared plus y squared,</span> <span m=''215000''>so that''s the same
  vector field that was on that problem set a</span> <span m=''220000''>couple of
  weeks ago. Then, well, f is not defined at</span> <span m=''225000''>the origin,
  but it''s defined everywhere else.</span> <span m=''232000''>And, wherever it''s
  defined, it''s curl is zero.</span> <span m=''243000''>I should say everywhere it''s
  -- And so, if we have a closed</span> <span m=''254000''>curve in the plane, well,
  there''s two situations.</span> <span m=''264000''>One is if it does not enclose
  the origin.</span> <span m=''268000''>Then, yes,</span> <span m=''270000''>we can
  apply Green''s theorem and it will tell us that it''s</span> <span m=''276000''>equal
  to the double integral in here of curl F dA,</span> <span m=''282000''>which will
  be zero because this is zero.</span> <span m=''286000''>However, if I have a curve
  that encloses</span> <span m=''291000''>the origin, let''s say like this,</span>
  <span m=''294000''>for example, then,</span> <span m=''303000''>well, I cannot use
  the same method because the vector field</span> <span m=''307000''>and its curl
  are not defined at the origin.</span> <span m=''311000''>And, in fact, you know
  that ignoring the</span> <span m=''314000''>problem and saying, well, the curl is
  still zero</span> <span m=''317000''>everywhere, will give you the wrong answer</span>
  <span m=''319000''>because we''ve seen an example. We''ve seen that along the unit</span>
  <span m=''323000''>circle the total work is 2 pi not zero.</span> <span m=''327000''>So,
  we can''t use Green. However, we can''t use it</span> <span m=''335000''>directly.
  So, there is an extended</span> <span m=''338000''>version of Green''s theorem that
  tells you the following thing.</span> <span m=''344000''>Well, it tells me that
  even though I</span> <span m=''349000''>can''t do things for just this region enclosed
  by C prime,</span> <span m=''354000''>I can still do things for the region in between
  two different</span> <span m=''358000''>curves. OK, so let me show you what I</span>
  <span m=''366000''>have in mind. So, let''s say that I have my</span> <span m=''371000''>curve
  C''. Where''s my yellow chalk?</span> <span m=''375000''>Oh, here. So, I have this
  curve C''.</span> <span m=''382000''>I can''t apply Green''s theorem inside it,
  but let''s get out the</span> <span m=''390000''>smaller thing. So, that one I''m
  going to make</span> <span m=''394000''>going clockwise. You will see why.</span>
  <span m=''401000''>Then, I could say, well, let me change my mind.</span> <span
  m=''408000''>This picture is not very well prepared.</span> <span m=''409000''>That''s
  because my writer is on strike.</span> <span m=''413000''>OK, so let''s say we have
  C'' and C'''' both going counterclockwise.</span> <span m=''422000''>Then, I claim
  that Green''s theorem</span> <span m=''425000''>still applies, and tells me that
  the line</span> <span m=''429000''>integral along C prime minus the line integral
  along C double</span> <span m=''434000''>prime is equal to the double integral over
  the region in</span> <span m=''439000''>between. So here, now,</span> <span m=''443000''>it''s
  this region with the hole of the curve.</span> <span m=''455000''>And, well, in
  our case, that will turn out to be zero</span> <span m=''461000''>because curl is
  zero. OK, so this doesn''t tell us</span> <span m=''465000''>what each of these
  two line integrals is.</span> <span m=''467000''>But actually, it tells us that
  they are equal</span> <span m=''469000''>to each other. And so, by computing one,</span>
  <span m=''471000''>you can see actually that for this vector field,</span> <span
  m=''473000''>if you take any curve that goes counterclockwise around the</span>
  <span m=''477000''>origin, you would get two pi no matter</span> <span m=''480000''>what
  the curve is. So how do you get to this?</span> <span m=''484000''>Why is this not
  like conceptually a new theorem?</span> <span m=''487000''>Well, just think of the
  following thing.</span> <span m=''493000''>I''m not going to do it on top of that
  because it''s going to be</span> <span m=''497000''>messy if I draw too many things.
  But, so here I have my C''''.</span> <span m=''503000''>Here, I have C''. Let me
  actually make a slit</span> <span m=''509000''>that will connect them to each other
  like this.</span> <span m=''513000''>So now if I take, see,</span> <span m=''517000''>I
  can form a single closed curve that will enclose all of</span> <span m=''523000''>this
  region with kind of an infinitely thin slit here</span> <span m=''529000''>counterclockwise.
  And so, if I go</span> <span m=''532000''>counterclockwise around this region, basically
  I go</span> <span m=''535000''>counterclockwise along the outer curve.</span> <span
  m=''538000''>Then I go along the slit. Then I go clockwise along the</span> <span
  m=''541000''>inside curve, then back along the slit.</span> <span m=''544000''>And
  then I''m done. So,</span> <span m=''547000''>if I take the line integral along
  this big curve consisting</span> <span m=''551000''>of all these pieces, now I can
  apply Green''s theorem</span> <span m=''555000''>to that because it is the usual
  counterclockwise curve that goes</span> <span m=''559000''>around a region where
  my field is well-defined.</span> <span m=''562000''>See, I''ve eliminated the origin
  from the picture.</span> <span m=''567000''>And, so the total line integral for
  this thing is equal to the</span> <span m=''577000''>integral along C prime, I guess
  the outer one.</span> <span m=''586000''>Then, I also need to have what I do along
  the inner side.</span> <span m=''590000''>And, the inner side is going to be C double
  prime,</span> <span m=''592000''>but going backwards because now I''m going clockwise
  on C prime</span> <span m=''597000''>so that I''m going counterclockwise around
  the</span> <span m=''601000''>shaded region. Well, of course there will be</span>
  <span m=''604000''>contributions from the line integral along this wide</span> <span
  m=''606000''>segment. But, I do it twice,</span> <span m=''608000''>once each way.
  So, they cancel out.</span> <span m=''617000''>So, the white segments cancel out.</span>
  <span m=''621000''>You probably shouldn''t, in your notes,</span> <span m=''623000''>write
  down white segments because probably they are not</span> <span m=''625000''>white
  on your paper. But, hopefully you get the</span> <span m=''629000''>meaning of what
  I''m trying to say.</span> <span m=''633000''>OK, so basically that tells you, you
  can still play tricks</span> <span m=''636000''>with Green''s theorem when the region
  has holes in it.</span> <span m=''639000''>You just had to be careful and somehow
  subtract some other</span> <span m=''644000''>curve so that together things will
  work out.</span> <span m=''648000''>There is a similar thing with the divergence
  theorem,</span> <span m=''651000''>of course, with flux and double integral of div
  f,</span> <span m=''655000''>you can apply exactly the same argument.</span> <span
  m=''658000''>OK, so basically you can apply Green''s theorem for a region</span>
  <span m=''662000''>that has several boundary curves.</span> <span m=''664000''>You
  just have to be careful that the outer boundary must go</span> <span m=''667000''>counterclockwise.
  The inner boundary either goes</span> <span m=''673000''>clockwise, or you put a
  minus sign.</span> <span m=''679000''>OK, and the last cultural note,</span> <span
  m=''686000''>so, the definition, we say that a region in the</span> <span m=''694000''>plane,
  sorry, I should say a connected</span> <span m=''696000''>region in the plane, so
  that means -- So,</span> <span m=''705000''>connected means it consists of a single
  piece.</span> <span m=''707000''>OK, so, connected, there is a single piece.</span>
  <span m=''710000''>These two guys together are not connected.</span> <span m=''713000''>But,
  if I join them, then this is a connected</span> <span m=''718000''>region. We say
  it''s simply connected --</span> <span m=''728000''>-- if any closed curve in it,
  OK,</span> <span m=''737000''>so I need to gave a name to my region,</span> <span
  m=''738000''>let''s say R, any closed curve in R,</span> <span m=''742000''>bounds,
  no,</span> <span m=''749000''>sorry. If the interior of any closed</span> <span
  m=''757000''>curve in R -- -- is also contained in R.</span> <span m=''769000''>So,
  concretely, what does that mean?</span> <span m=''771000''>That means the region,
  R, does not have any holes</span> <span m=''777000''>inside it. Maybe I should draw
  two</span> <span m=''782000''>pictures to explain what I mean. So,</span> <span
  m=''788000''>this guy here is simply connected while -- -- this guy</span> <span
  m=''797000''>here is not simply connected because if I take this curve,</span> <span
  m=''809000''>that''s a curve inside my region. But, the piece that it bounds</span>
  <span m=''814000''>is not actually entirely contained in my origin.</span> <span
  m=''818000''>And, so why is that relevant? Well,</span> <span m=''821000''>if you
  know that your vector field is defined everywhere in a</span> <span m=''825000''>simply
  connected region, then you don''t have to worry</span> <span m=''827000''>about
  this question of, can I apply Green''s theorem to</span> <span m=''830000''>the
  inside? You know it''s automatically OK</span> <span m=''832000''>because if you
  have a closed curve,</span> <span m=''834000''>then the vector field is, I mean,
  if a vector field is</span> <span m=''839000''>defined on the curve it will also
  be defined inside.</span> <span m=''843000''>OK, so if the domain of definition</span>
  <span m=''851000''>-- -- of a vector field is defined and differentiable -- --</span>
  <span m=''865000''>is simply connected -- -- then we can always apply -- --</span>
  <span m=''878000''>Green''s theorem -- -- and, of course,</span> <span m=''887000''>provided
  that we do it on a curve where the vector field is</span> <span m=''889000''>defined.
  I mean, your line integral</span> <span m=''890000''>doesn''t make sense so there''s
  nothing to compute.</span> <span m=''893000''>But, if you have, so, again, the argument
  would</span> <span m=''896000''>be, well, if a vector field is defined on the curve,</span>
  <span m=''899000''>it''s also defined inside. So,</span> <span m=''901000''>see,
  the problem with that vector</span> <span m=''904000''>field here is precisely that
  its domain of definition is not</span> <span m=''907000''>simply connected because
  there is a hole,</span> <span m=''909000''>namely the origin. OK, so for this guy,</span>
  <span m=''917000''>domain of definition, which is plane minus the origin</span>
  <span m=''928000''>with the origin removed is not simply connected.</span> <span
  m=''939000''>And so that''s why you have this line integral that makes perfect</span>
  <span m=''942000''>sense, but you can''t apply Green''s theorem to it.</span> <span
  m=''945000''>So now, what does that mean a particular?</span> <span m=''947000''>Well,
  we''ve seen this criterion that if a curl of the vector</span> <span m=''951000''>field
  is zero and it''s defined in the entire plane,</span> <span m=''955000''>then the
  vector field is conservative,</span> <span m=''958000''>and it''s a gradient field.
  And, the argument to prove that</span> <span m=''961000''>is basically to use Green''s
  theorem.</span> <span m=''963000''>So, in fact, the actual optimal statement</span>
  <span m=''967000''>you can make is if a vector field is defined in a simply</span>
  <span m=''971000''>connected region, and its curl is zero,</span> <span m=''973000''>then
  it''s a gradient field. So, let me just write that down.</span> <span m=''986000''>So,
  the correct statement, I mean, the previous one we''ve</span> <span m=''989000''>seen
  is also correct. But this one is somehow better</span> <span m=''995000''>and closer
  to what exactly is needed if curl F is zero and the</span> <span m=''1005000''>domain
  of definition where F is defined is simply connected --</span> <span m=''1015000''>--
  then F is conservative. And that means also it''s a</span> <span m=''1024000''>gradient
  field. It''s the same thing.</span> <span m=''1031000''>OK, any questions on this?
  No?</span> <span m=''1043000''>OK, some good news. What I''ve just said here won''t</span>
  <span m=''1047000''>come up on the test on Thursday. OK.</span> <span m=''1051000''>(APPLAUSE)
  Still, it''s stuff that you should be</span> <span m=''1055000''>aware of generally
  speaking because it will be useful,</span> <span m=''1059000''>say, on the next
  week''s problem set.</span> <span m=''1062000''>And, maybe on the final it would
  be,</span> <span m=''1066000''>there won''t be any really, really complicated things</span>
  <span m=''1068000''>probably, but you might need to be at</span> <span m=''1073000''>least
  vaguely aware of this issue of things being simply</span> <span m=''1081000''>connected.
  And by the way,</span> <span m=''1084000''>I mean, this is also somehow the starting
  point of topology,</span> <span m=''1088000''>which is the branch of math that studies
  the shapes of</span> <span m=''1092000''>regions. So,</span> <span m=''1093000''>in
  particular, you can try to distinguish</span> <span m=''1095000''>domains in the
  plains by looking at whether they''re simply</span> <span m=''1098000''>connected
  or not, and what kinds of features they</span> <span m=''1101000''>have in terms
  of how you can joint point what kinds of curves</span> <span m=''1105000''>exist
  in them. And, since that''s the branch of</span> <span m=''1108000''>math in which
  I work, I thought I should tell you a</span> <span m=''1112000''>bit about it. OK,
  so now back to reviewing</span> <span m=''1121000''>for the exam. So, I''m going
  to basically list</span> <span m=''1127000''>topics. And, if time permits,</span>
  <span m=''1129000''>I will say a few things about problems from practice exam 3B.</span>
  <span m=''1133000''>I''m hoping that you have it or your neighbor has it,</span>
  <span m=''1136000''>or you can somehow get it. Anyway, given time,</span> <span
  m=''1139000''>I''m not sure how much I will say about the problems in and of</span>
  <span m=''1144000''>themselves. OK, so the main thing to know</span> <span m=''1148000''>about
  this exam is how to set up and evaluate double integrals</span> <span m=''1153000''>and
  line integrals. OK, if you know how to do these</span> <span m=''1157000''>two things,
  then you are in much better shape than if you don''t.</span> <span m=''1166000''>And
  -- So, the first thing we''ve seen, just to write it</span> <span m=''1183000''>down,
  there''s two main objects. And, it''s kind of important to</span> <span m=''1195000''>not
  confuse them with each other.</span> <span m=''1197000''>OK, there''s double integrals
  of our regions of some quantity,</span> <span m=''1202000''>dA, and the other one
  is the line</span> <span m=''1206000''>integral along a curve of a vector field,</span>
  <span m=''1211000''>F.dr or F.Mds depending on whether it''s work or flux that</span>
  <span m=''1217000''>we are trying to do. And, so we should know how to</span> <span
  m=''1221000''>set up these things and how to evaluate them.</span> <span m=''1224000''>And,
  roughly speaking, in this one you start by</span> <span m=''1227000''>drawing a
  picture of the region, then deciding which way you</span> <span m=''1232000''>will
  integrate it. It could be dx dy,</span> <span m=''1234000''>dy dx, r dr d theta,</span>
  <span m=''1237000''>and then you will set up the bound carefully by slicing it</span>
  <span m=''1241000''>and studying how the bounds for the inner variable depend on
  the</span> <span m=''1245000''>outer variable. So, the first topic will be</span>
  <span m=''1251000''>setting up double integrals. And so, remember,</span> <span
  m=''1257000''>OK, so maybe I should make this more explicit.</span> <span m=''1263000''>We
  want to draw a picture of R and take slices in the chosen</span> <span m=''1272000''>way
  so that we get an iterated integral.</span> <span m=''1278000''>OK, so let''s do
  just a quick example.</span> <span m=''1285000''>So, if I look at problem one on
  the exam 3B,</span> <span m=''1298000''>it says to look at the line integral from
  zero to one,</span> <span m=''1303000''>line integral from x to 2x of possibly something,</span>
  <span m=''1306000''>but dy dx. And it says,</span> <span m=''1310000''>let''s look
  at how we would set this up the other way around by</span> <span m=''1318000''>exchanging
  x and y. So, we should get to something</span> <span m=''1323000''>that will be
  the same integral dx dy.</span> <span m=''1326000''>I mean, if you have a function
  of x and y, then it will be the</span> <span m=''1329000''>same function. But, of
  course,</span> <span m=''1331000''>the bounds change. So, how do we exchange the</span>
  <span m=''1334000''>order of integration? Well, the only way to do it</span> <span
  m=''1337000''>consistently is to draw a picture.</span> <span m=''1340000''>So,
  let''s see, what does this mean?</span> <span m=''1343000''>Here, it means we integrate
  from y equals x to y equals 2x,</span> <span m=''1348000''>x between zero and one.
  So, we should draw a picture.</span> <span m=''1352000''>The lower bound for y is
  y equals x.</span> <span m=''1355000''>So, let''s draw y equals x. That seems to
  be here.</span> <span m=''1361000''>And, we''ll go up to y equals 2x, which is a
  line also but</span> <span m=''1367000''>with bigger slope. And then, all right,</span>
  <span m=''1372000''>so for each value of x, my origin will go from x to 2x.</span>
  <span m=''1378000''>Well, and I do this for all values of x that go to x equals</span>
  <span m=''1383000''>one. So, I stop at x equals one,</span> <span m=''1386000''>which
  is here. And then, my region is</span> <span m=''1390000''>something like this.
  OK, so this point here,</span> <span m=''1395000''>in case you are wondering, well,
  when x equals one,</span> <span m=''1401000''>y is one. And that point here is one,
  two.</span> <span m=''1407000''>OK, any questions about that so far?</span> <span
  m=''1409000''>OK, so somehow that''s the first kill, when you see an integral,</span>
  <span m=''1413000''>how to figure out what it means, how to draw the region.</span>
  <span m=''1416000''>And then there''s a converse scale which is given the region,</span>
  <span m=''1419000''>how to set up the integral for it.</span> <span m=''1422000''>So,
  if we want to set up instead dx dy,</span> <span m=''1426000''>then it means we
  are going to actually look at the converse</span> <span m=''1430000''>question which
  is, for a given value of y,</span> <span m=''1434000''>what is the range of values
  of x?</span> <span m=''1437000''>OK, so if we fix y, well, where do we enter the</span>
  <span m=''1441000''>region, and where do we leave it?</span> <span m=''1444000''>So,
  we seem to enter on this side, and we seem to leave on</span> <span m=''1448000''>that
  side. At least that seems to be true</span> <span m=''1450000''>for the first few
  values of y that I choose.</span> <span m=''1452000''>But, hey, if I take a larger
  value of y, then I will enter on</span> <span m=''1456000''>the side, and I will
  leave on this vertical side,</span> <span m=''1459000''>not on that one. So, I seem
  to have two</span> <span m=''1462000''>different things going on. OK, the place
  where enter my</span> <span m=''1468000''>region is always y equals 2x, which is
  the same as x equals y</span> <span m=''1478000''>over two. So, x seems to always
  start at</span> <span m=''1485000''>y over two. But, where I leave to be either</span>
  <span m=''1491000''>x equals y, or here, x equals y.</span> <span m=''1495000''>And,
  that depends on the value of y.</span> <span m=''1497000''>So, in fact, I have to
  break this into two</span> <span m=''1499000''>different integrals. I have to treat
  separately the</span> <span m=''1503000''>case where y is between zero and one,
  and between one and two.</span> <span m=''1507000''>So, what I do in that case is
  I just make two integrals.</span> <span m=''1515000''>So, I say, both of them start
  at y over two.</span> <span m=''1518000''>But, in the first case, we''ll stop at
  x equals y.</span> <span m=''1522000''>In the second case, we''ll stop at x equals
  one.</span> <span m=''1530000''>OK, and now, what are the values of y for</span>
  <span m=''1531000''>each case? Well, the first case is when y</span> <span m=''1534000''>is
  between zero and one. The second case is when y is</span> <span m=''1538000''>between
  one and two, which I guess this picture now</span> <span m=''1540000''>is completely
  unreadable, but hopefully you''ve been</span> <span m=''1544000''>following what''s
  going on, or else you can see it in the</span> <span m=''1548000''>solutions to
  the problem. And, so that''s our final answer.</span> <span m=''1553000''>OK, any
  questions about how to set up double integrals in xy</span> <span m=''1561000''>coordinates?
  No?</span> <span m=''1564000''>OK, who feels comfortable with this kind of problem?</span>
  <span m=''1567000''>OK, good. I''m happy to see the vast</span> <span m=''1571000''>majority.
  So, the bad news is we have to</span> <span m=''1576000''>be able to do it not only
  in xy coordinates, but also in polar</span> <span m=''1583000''>coordinates. So,
  when you go to polar</span> <span m=''1587000''>coordinates, basically all you have
  to remember on the side of</span> <span m=''1592000''>integrand is that x becomes
  r cosine theta.</span> <span m=''1596000''>Y becomes r sine theta. And, dx dy becomes
  r dr d theta.</span> <span m=''1605000''>In terms of how you slice for your region,
  well,</span> <span m=''1609000''>you will be integrating first over r.</span> <span
  m=''1612000''>So, that means what you''re doing is you''re fixing the value</span>
  <span m=''1617000''>of theta. And, for that value of theta,</span> <span m=''1619000''>you
  ask yourself, for what range of values of r</span> <span m=''1623000''>am I going
  to be inside my origin?</span> <span m=''1626000''>So, if my origin looks like this,
  then for this value of</span> <span m=''1629000''>theta, r would go from zero to
  whatever this distance is.</span> <span m=''1633000''>And of course I have to find
  how this distance depends on</span> <span m=''1636000''>theta. And then, I will
  find the</span> <span m=''1638000''>extreme values of theta. Now, of course,</span>
  <span m=''1640000''>is the origin is really looking like this, then you''re not
  going</span> <span m=''1642000''>to do it in polar coordinates. But, if it''s like
  a circle or a</span> <span m=''1645000''>half circle, or things like that,</span>
  <span m=''1647000''>then even if a problem doesn''t tell you to do it in polar</span>
  <span m=''1651000''>coordinates you might want to seriously consider it.</span>
  <span m=''1654000''>OK, so I''m not going to do it but problem two in the practice</span>
  <span m=''1658000''>exam is a good example of doing something in polar coordinates.</span>
  <span m=''1663000''>OK, so in terms of things that we</span> <span m=''1670000''>do
  with double integrals, there''s a few formulas that I''d</span> <span m=''1676000''>like
  you to remember about applications that we''ve seen of</span> <span m=''1680000''>double
  integrals. So, quantities that we can</span> <span m=''1684000''>compute with double
  integrals include things like the area of</span> <span m=''1690000''>region, its
  mass if it has a density,</span> <span m=''1693000''>the average value of some function,</span>
  <span m=''1696000''>for example, the average value of the x and</span> <span m=''1699000''>y
  coordinates, which we called the center of</span> <span m=''1702000''>mass or moments
  of inertia. So, these are just formulas to</span> <span m=''1711000''>remember.
  So, for example,</span> <span m=''1715000''>the area of region is the double integral
  of just dA,</span> <span m=''1720000''>or if it helps you, one dA if you want.</span>
  <span m=''1724000''>You are integrating the function 1.</span> <span m=''1727000''>You
  have to remember formulas for mass,</span> <span m=''1729000''>for the average value
  of a function is the F bar,</span> <span m=''1734000''>in particular x bar y bar,
  which is the center of mass,</span> <span m=''1745000''>and the moment of inertia.
  OK, so the polar moment of</span> <span m=''1754000''>inertia, which is moment of
  inertia about the origin.</span> <span m=''1758000''>OK, so that''s double integral
  of x squared plus y squared,</span> <span m=''1762000''>density dA, but also moments
  of inertia</span> <span m=''1767000''>about the x and y axis, which are given by
  just taking</span> <span m=''1773000''>one of these guys. Don''t worry about moments
  of</span> <span m=''1776000''>inertia about an arbitrary line. I will ask you for
  a moment of</span> <span m=''1779000''>inertia for some weird line or something
  like that.</span> <span m=''1782000''>OK, but these you should know. Now, what if
  you somehow,</span> <span m=''1787000''>on the spur of the moment, you forget, what''s
  the formula</span> <span m=''1789000''>for moment of inertia? Well, I mean,</span>
  <span m=''1791000''>I prefer if you know, but if you have a complete</span> <span
  m=''1794000''>blank in your memory, there will still be partial</span> <span m=''1796000''>credit
  were setting up the bounds and everything else.</span> <span m=''1799000''>So, the
  general rule for the exam</span> <span m=''1801000''>will be if you''re stuck in
  a calculation or you''re missing a</span> <span m=''1804000''>little piece of the
  puzzle, try to do as much as you can.</span> <span m=''1808000''>In particular,
  try to at least set up the</span> <span m=''1810000''>bounds of the integral. There
  will be partial credit</span> <span m=''1815000''>for that always. So, while we''re
  at it about</span> <span m=''1821000''>grand rules, how about evaluation?</span>
  <span m=''1826000''>How about evaluating integrals? So, once you''ve set it up,</span>
  <span m=''1831000''>you have to sometimes compute it.</span> <span m=''1833000''>First
  of all, check just in case the problem</span> <span m=''1836000''>says set up but
  do not evaluate. Then, don''t waste your time</span> <span m=''1840000''>evaluating
  it. If a problem says to compute</span> <span m=''1845000''>it, then you have to
  compute it. So, what kinds of integration</span> <span m=''1850000''>techniques
  do you need to know? So, you need to know,</span> <span m=''1854000''>you must know,
  well, how to integrate the</span> <span m=''1857000''>usual functions like one over
  x or x to the n,</span> <span m=''1861000''>or exponential, sine, cosine,</span>
  <span m=''1865000''>things like that, OK, so the usual integrals.</span> <span m=''1868000''>You
  must know what I will call easy trigonometry.</span> <span m=''1876000''>OK, I don''t
  want to give you a complete list.</span> <span m=''1877000''>And the more you ask
  me about which ones are on the list,</span> <span m=''1880000''>the more I will
  add to the list.</span> <span m=''1882000''>But, those that you know that you should
  know,</span> <span m=''1886000''>you should know. Those that you think you</span>
  <span m=''1888000''>shouldn''t know, you don''t have to know because</span> <span
  m=''1891000''>I will say what I will say soon. You should know also</span> <span
  m=''1896000''>substitution, how to set U equals something,</span> <span m=''1901000''>and
  then see, oh, this becomes u times du,</span> <span m=''1905000''>and so substitution
  method. What do I mean by easy</span> <span m=''1910000''>trigonometrics? Well,
  certainly you should know</span> <span m=''1912000''>how to ingrate sine. You should
  know how to</span> <span m=''1914000''>integrate cosine. You should be aware that
  sine</span> <span m=''1917000''>squared plus cosine squared simplifies to one.</span>
  <span m=''1921000''>And, you should be aware of general things like that.</span>
  <span m=''1923000''>I would like you to know, maybe, the double angles,</span> <span
  m=''1926000''>sine 2x and cosine 2x. Know what these are,</span> <span m=''1929000''>and
  the kinds of the easy things you can do with that,</span> <span m=''1932000''>also
  things that involve substitution setting like U</span> <span m=''1936000''>equals
  sine T or U equals cosine T.</span> <span m=''1939000''>I mean, let me, instead,
  give an example of</span> <span m=''1941000''>hard trig that you don''t need to
  know, and then I will answer.</span> <span m=''1945000''>OK, so, not needed on Thursday;
  it doesn''t mean that I don''t</span> <span m=''1954000''>want you to know them.
  I would love you to know every</span> <span m=''1957000''>single integral formula.
  But, that shouldn''t be your top</span> <span m=''1961000''>priority. So, you don''t
  need to know</span> <span m=''1964000''>things like hard trigonometric ones.</span>
  <span m=''1967000''>So, let me give you an example. OK, so if I ask you to do this</span>
  <span m=''1972000''>one, then actually I will give you maybe, you know,</span> <span
  m=''1975000''>I will reprint the formula from the notes or something like</span>
  <span m=''1979000''>that. OK, so that one you don''t need</span> <span m=''1982000''>to
  know. I would love if you happen to</span> <span m=''1984000''>know it, but if you
  need it, it will be given to you.</span> <span m=''1987000''>So, these kinds of
  things that you cannot compute by any easy</span> <span m=''1993000''>method. And,
  integration by parts,</span> <span m=''1996000''>I believe that I successfully test-solved
  all the problems</span> <span m=''2001000''>without doing any single integration
  by parts.</span> <span m=''2006000''>Again, in general, it''s something that I would</span>
  <span m=''2009000''>like you to know, but it shouldn''t be a top</span> <span m=''2013000''>priority
  for this week. OK, sorry, you had a question,</span> <span m=''2020000''>or? Inverse
  trigonometric</span> <span m=''2022000''>functions: let''s say the most easy ones.</span>
  <span m=''2025000''>I would like you to know the easiest inverse trig functions,</span>
  <span m=''2030000''>but not much. OK, OK, so be aware that these</span> <span m=''2036000''>functions
  exist, but it''s not a top priority.</span> <span m=''2044000''>I should say, the
  more I tell you I don''t</span> <span m=''2046000''>need you to know, the more your
  physics and other</span> <span m=''2048000''>teachers might complain that, oh, these
  guys don''t know how</span> <span m=''2051000''>to integrate. So, try not to forget</span>
  <span m=''2052000''>everything. But, yes?</span> <span m=''2059000''>No, no, here
  I just mean for evaluating just a single</span> <span m=''2062000''>variable integral.
  I will get to change variables</span> <span m=''2064000''>and Jacobian soon, but
  I''m thinking of this as a</span> <span m=''2067000''>different topic. What I mean
  by this one is if</span> <span m=''2069000''>I''m asking you to integrate, I don''t
  know,</span> <span m=''2072000''>what''s a good example? Zero to one t dt over square</span>
  <span m=''2077000''>root of one plus t squared, then you should think of maybe</span>
  <span m=''2082000''>substituting u equals one plus t squared,</span> <span m=''2084000''>and
  then it becomes easier. OK, so this kind of trig,</span> <span m=''2095000''>that''s
  what I have in mind here specifically.</span> <span m=''2100000''>And again, if
  you''re stuck,</span> <span m=''2102000''>in particular, if you hit this dreaded
  guy,</span> <span m=''2105000''>and you don''t actually have a formula giving you
  what it is,</span> <span m=''2109000''>it means one of two things. One is something''s
  wrong with</span> <span m=''2112000''>your solution. The other option is something</span>
  <span m=''2113000''>is wrong with my problem. So, either way,</span> <span m=''2116000''>check
  quickly what you''ve done it if you can''t find a mistake,</span> <span m=''2122000''>then
  just move ahead to the next problem.</span> <span m=''2127000''>Which one, this
  one? Yeah,</span> <span m=''2130000''>I mean if you can do it, if you know how to
  do it,</span> <span m=''2132000''>which everything is fair: I mean,</span> <span
  m=''2133000''>generally speaking, give enough of it so that you</span> <span m=''2136000''>found
  the solution by yourself, not like,</span> <span m=''2138000''>you know, it didn''t
  somehow come to you by magic.</span> <span m=''2143000''>But, yeah, if you know
  how to integrate this without doing the</span> <span m=''2147000''>substitution,
  that''s absolutely fine by me.</span> <span m=''2149000''>Just show enough work.
  The general rule is show enough</span> <span m=''2153000''>work that we see that
  you knew what you are doing.</span> <span m=''2158000''>OK, now another thing we''ve
  seen with double integrals is</span> <span m=''2162000''>how to do more complicated
  changes of variables.</span> <span m=''2178000''>So, when you want to replace x
  and y by some variables,</span> <span m=''2183000''>u and v, given by some formulas
  in terms of x and y.</span> <span m=''2188000''>So, you need to remember basically
  how to do them.</span> <span m=''2193000''>So, you need to remember that the method
  consists of three</span> <span m=''2196000''>steps. So, one is you have to find
  the</span> <span m=''2203000''>Jacobian. And, you can choose to do</span> <span
  m=''2206000''>either this Jacobian or the inverse one depending on what''s</span>
  <span m=''2210000''>easiest given what you''re given. You don''t have to worry about</span>
  <span m=''2213000''>solving for things the other way around.</span> <span m=''2215000''>Just
  compute one of these Jacobians.</span> <span m=''2218000''>And then, the rule is
  that du dv is absolute value of the</span> <span m=''2226000''>Jacobian dx dy. So,
  that takes care of dx dy,</span> <span m=''2232000''>how to convert that into du
  dv. The second thing to know is</span> <span m=''2238000''>that, well,</span> <span
  m=''2240000''>you need to of course substitute any x and y''s in the</span> <span
  m=''2245000''>integrand to convert them to u''s and v''s so that you have a valid</span>
  <span m=''2252000''>integrand involving only u and v.</span> <span m=''2256000''>And
  then, the last part is setting up the bounds.</span> <span m=''2271000''>And you
  see that, probably you seen on P-sets and</span> <span m=''2274000''>an example
  we did in the lecture that this can be complicated.</span> <span m=''2278000''>But
  now, in real life, you do this actually to</span> <span m=''2280000''>simplify the
  integrals. So,</span> <span m=''2282000''>probably the one that will be there on
  Thursday,</span> <span m=''2284000''>if there''s a problem about that on Thursday,</span>
  <span m=''2287000''>it will be a situation where the bounds that you get after</span>
  <span m=''2290000''>changing variables are reasonably easy.</span> <span m=''2293000''>OK,
  I''m not saying that it will be completely obvious</span> <span m=''2295000''>necessarily,
  but it will be a fairly easy situation.</span> <span m=''2297000''>So, the general
  method is you look at your region,</span> <span m=''2302000''>R, and it might have
  various sides.</span> <span m=''2305000''>Well, on each side you ask yourself, what
  do I know about x</span> <span m=''2309000''>and y, and how to convert that in terms
  of u and v?</span> <span m=''2313000''>And maybe you''ll find that the equation
  might be just u equals</span> <span m=''2317000''>zero for example, or u equals
  v,</span> <span m=''2319000''>or something like that. And then, it''s up to you
  to</span> <span m=''2322000''>decide what you want to do. But, maybe the easiest
  usually</span> <span m=''2326000''>is to draw a new picture in terms of u and v
  coordinates of</span> <span m=''2329000''>what your region will look like in the
  new coordinates.</span> <span m=''2333000''>It might be that it will actually much
  easier.</span> <span m=''2335000''>It should be easier looking than what you started
  with.</span> <span m=''2340000''>OK, so that''s the general idea. There is one change
  of variable</span> <span m=''2345000''>problem on each of the two practice exams
  to give you a</span> <span m=''2349000''>feeling for what''s realistic. The problem
  that''s on practice</span> <span m=''2353000''>exam 3B actually is on the hard side
  of things because the</span> <span m=''2358000''>question is kind of hidden in a
  way.</span> <span m=''2361000''>So, if you look at problem six, you might find that
  it''s not</span> <span m=''2365000''>telling you very clearly what you have to do.</span>
  <span m=''2368000''>That''s because it was meant to be the hardest problem on that</span>
  <span m=''2374000''>test. But, once you''ve reduced it to</span> <span m=''2377000''>an
  actual change of variables problem, I expect you to be able</span> <span m=''2381000''>to
  know how to do it. And, on practice exam 3A,</span> <span m=''2384000''>there''s
  also, I think it''s problem five on</span> <span m=''2388000''>the other practice
  exam. And, that one is actually</span> <span m=''2392000''>pretty standard and straightforward.</span>
  <span m=''2395000''>OK, time to move on, sorry. So, we''ve also seen about line</span>
  <span m=''2400000''>integrals.</span> <span m=''2421000''>OK, so line integrals,</span>
  <span m=''2430000''>so the main thing to know about them,</span> <span m=''2433000''>so
  the line integral for work, which is line integral of F.dr,</span> <span m=''2437000''>so
  let''s say that your vector field has components,</span> <span m=''2440000''>M and
  N. So, the line integral for work</span> <span m=''2449000''>becomes in coordinates
  integral of Mdx plus Ndy while we''ve also</span> <span m=''2457000''>seen line
  integral for flux. So, line integral of F.n ds</span> <span m=''2465000''>becomes
  the integral along C just to make sure that I give it</span> <span m=''2473000''>to
  you correctly. So, remember that just,</span> <span m=''2478000''>I don''t want
  to make the mistake in front of you.</span> <span m=''2482000''>So, T ds is dx,
  dy. And, the normal vector,</span> <span m=''2490000''>so, T ds goes along the curve.
  Nds goes clockwise</span> <span m=''2496000''>perpendicular to the curve. So, it''s
  going to be,</span> <span m=''2501000''>well, it''s going to be dy and negative
  dx.</span> <span m=''2508000''>So, you will be integrating negative Ndx plus Mdy.</span>
  <span m=''2520000''>OK, see, if you are blanking and don''t remember the signs,</span>
  <span m=''2524000''>then you can just draw this picture and make sure that you</span>
  <span m=''2527000''>get it right. So, you should know a little</span> <span m=''2530000''>bit
  about geometric interpretation and how to see</span> <span m=''2534000''>easily
  that it''s going to be zero in some cases.</span> <span m=''2537000''>But, mostly
  you should know how to compute, set up and compute</span> <span m=''2541000''>these
  things. So, what do we do when we are</span> <span m=''2543000''>here? Well, it''s
  year,</span> <span m=''2544000''>we have both x and y together, but we want to,</span>
  <span m=''2547000''>because it''s the line integral, there should be only one</span>
  <span m=''2550000''>variable. So, the important thing to know</span> <span m=''2554000''>is
  we want to reduce everything to a single parameter.</span> <span m=''2559000''>OK,
  so the evaluation method is always by reducing to a single</span> <span m=''2575000''>parameter.
  So, for example,</span> <span m=''2581000''>maybe x and y are both functions of
  some variable,</span> <span m=''2586000''>t, and then express everything in</span>
  <span m=''2590000''>terms of some integral of, some quantity involving t dt.</span>
  <span m=''2598000''>It could be that you will just express everything in terms of
  x</span> <span m=''2601000''>or in terms of y, or in terms of some angle or</span>
  <span m=''2604000''>something. It''s up to you to choose how to</span> <span m=''2606000''>parameterize
  things. And then, when you''re there,</span> <span m=''2609000''>it''s a usual one
  variable integral with a single variable</span> <span m=''2613000''>in there. OK,
  so that''s the general</span> <span m=''2616000''>method of calculation, but we''ve
  seen a shortcut for</span> <span m=''2620000''>work when we can show that the field
  is the gradient of</span> <span m=''2625000''>potential. So,</span> <span m=''2628000''>one
  thing to know is if the curl of F,</span> <span m=''2635000''>which is an x minus
  My happens to be zero,</span> <span m=''2641000''>well, and now I can say,</span>
  <span m=''2643000''>and the domain is simply connected,</span> <span m=''2646000''>or
  if the field is defined everywhere,</span> <span m=''2651000''>then F is actually
  a gradient field.</span> <span m=''2659000''>So, that means, just to make it more
  concrete,</span> <span m=''2662000''>that means we can find a function little f
  called the</span> <span m=''2666000''>potential such that its derivative respect
  to x is M,</span> <span m=''2670000''>and its derivative with respect to Y is N.</span>
  <span m=''2672000''>We can solve these two conditions for the same</span> <span
  m=''2677000''>function, f, simultaneously. And, how do we find this</span> <span
  m=''2682000''>function, little f? OK, so that''s the same as</span> <span m=''2686000''>saying
  that the field, big F, is the gradient of</span> <span m=''2690000''>little f. And,
  how do we find this</span> <span m=''2692000''>function, little f? Well, we''ve
  seen two methods.</span> <span m=''2694000''>One of them involves computing a line
  integral from the origin</span> <span m=''2698000''>to a point in the plane by going
  first along the x axis,</span> <span m=''2702000''>then vertically. The other method
  was to first</span> <span m=''2705000''>figure out what this one tells us by integrating
  it with</span> <span m=''2709000''>respect to x. And then, we differentiate our</span>
  <span m=''2712000''>answer with respect to y, and we compare with that to get</span>
  <span m=''2717000''>the complete answer. OK, so I is that relevant?</span> <span
  m=''2720000''>Well, first of all it''s relevant in</span> <span m=''2722000''>physics,
  but it''s also relevant just to</span> <span m=''2725000''>calculation of line integrals
  because we see the fundamental</span> <span m=''2729000''>theorem of calculus for
  line integrals which says if we are</span> <span m=''2734000''>integrating a gradient
  field and we know what the potential is.</span> <span m=''2739000''>Then, we just
  have to, well, the line integral is just</span> <span m=''2743000''>the change in
  value of a potential.</span> <span m=''2746000''>OK, so we take the value of a potential
  at the starting point,</span> <span m=''2749000''>sorry, we take value potential
  at the endpoint minus the value</span> <span m=''2752000''>at the starting point.
  And, that will give us the line</span> <span m=''2758000''>integral, OK? So, important:</span>
  <span m=''2760000''>this is only for work. There''s no statement like that</span>
  <span m=''2765000''>for flux, OK, so don''t tried to fly this in a</span> <span
  m=''2769000''>problem about flux. I mean, usually,</span> <span m=''2771000''>if
  you look at the practice exams,</span> <span m=''2773000''>you will see it''s pretty
  clear that there''s one problem in</span> <span m=''2777000''>which you are supposed
  to do things this way.</span> <span m=''2780000''>It''s kind of a dead giveaway,
  but it''s probably not too bad.</span> <span m=''2785000''>OK, and the other thing
  we''ve seen, so I mentioned it at the</span> <span m=''2789000''>beginning but let
  me mention it again.</span> <span m=''2792000''>To compute things, Green''s theorem,</span>
  <span m=''2796000''>let''s just compute, well, let us forget,</span> <span m=''2802000''>sorry,
  find the value of a line integral along the closed curve</span> <span m=''2805000''>by
  reducing it to double integral.</span> <span m=''2807000''>So, the one for work
  says -- --</span> <span m=''2815000''>this, and you should remember that in</span>
  <span m=''2819000''>there, so C is a closed curve that</span> <span m=''2821000''>goes
  counterclockwise, and R is the region inside.</span> <span m=''2825000''>So, the
  way you would, if you had to compute both</span> <span m=''2828000''>sides separately,
  you would do them in extremely</span> <span m=''2830000''>different ways, right?</span>
  <span m=''2832000''>This one is a line integral. So, you use the method to</span>
  <span m=''2835000''>explain here, namely, you express x and y in</span> <span m=''2838000''>terms
  of a single variable. See that you''re doing a circle.</span> <span m=''2842000''>I
  want to see a theta. I don''t want to see an R.</span> <span m=''2844000''>R is
  not a variable. You are on the circle.</span> <span m=''2847000''>This one is a
  double integral. So, if you are doing it,</span> <span m=''2850000''>say, on a disk,
  you would have both R and theta</span> <span m=''2852000''>if you''re using polar
  coordinates.</span> <span m=''2854000''>You would have both x and y. Here, you have
  two variables of</span> <span m=''2857000''>integration. Here, you should have only
  one</span> <span m=''2860000''>after you parameterize the curve.</span> <span m=''2862000''>And,
  the fact that it stays curl F, I mean,</span> <span m=''2866000''>curl F is just
  Nx-My is just like any function of x and y.</span> <span m=''2871000''>OK, the fact
  that we called it curl F doesn''t change how you</span> <span m=''2874000''>compute
  it. You have first to compute the</span> <span m=''2876000''>curl of F. Say you
  find,</span> <span m=''2878000''>I don''t know, xy minus x squared,</span> <span
  m=''2880000''>well, it becomes just the usual double integral of the usual</span>
  <span m=''2884000''>function xy minus x squared. There''s nothing special to it</span>
  <span m=''2889000''>because it''s a curl. And, the other one is the</span> <span
  m=''2895000''>counterpart for flux. So, it says this,</span> <span m=''2901000''>and
  remember this is mx plus ny.</span> <span m=''2905000''>I mean, what''s important
  about these statements is not only</span> <span m=''2907000''>remembering, you know,
  if you just know this formula</span> <span m=''2910000''>by heart, you are still
  in trouble</span> <span m=''2912000''>because you need to know what actually the
  symbols in here</span> <span m=''2915000''>mean. So, you should remember,</span>
  <span m=''2917000''>what is this line integral, and what''s the divergence of a</span>
  <span m=''2920000''>field? So, just something to remember.</span> <span m=''2927000''>And,
  so I guess I''ll let you figure out practice problems</span> <span m=''2931000''>because
  it''s time, but I think that''s basically</span> <span m=''2934000''>the list of
  all we''ve seen. And, well, that should be it.</span> </p>'
