  </p><p><span m='23000'>Thank you. Let's continue with vectors and</span> <span m='30000'>operations
  of them. Remember we saw the topic</span> <span m='37000'>yesterday was dot product.
  And remember the definition of</span> <span m='46000'>dot product, well, the dot
  product of two</span> <span m='51000'>vectors is obtained by multiplying the first
  component</span> <span m='55000'>with the first component, the second with the second
  and</span> <span m='59000'>so on and summing these and you get the scalar.</span>
  </p><p><span m='61000'>And the geometric interpretation of that is that</span> <span
  m='65000'>you can also take the length of A,</span> <span m='69000'>take the length
  of B multiply them and multiply that by the</span> <span m='76000'>cosine of the
  angle between the two vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='82000'>We have seen several
  applications of that.</span> </p><p><span m='94000'>One application is to find lengths
  and angles.</span> </p><p><span m='108000'>For example, you can use this relation
  to</span> <span m='112000'>give you the cosine of the angle between two vectors
  is the dot</span> <span m='119000'>product divided by the product of the lengths.</span>
  </p><p><span m='125000'>Another application that we have is to detect whether two</span>
  <span m='134000'>vectors are perpendicular. To decide if two vectors are</span>
  <span m='141000'>perpendicular to each other, all we have to do is compute</span>
  <span m='148000'>our dot product and see if we get zero.</span> </p><p><span m='154000'>And
  one further application that we did not have time to</span> <span m='161000'>discuss
  yesterday that I will mention very quickly is to find</span> <span m='169000'>components
  of, let's say, a vector A along a</span> <span m='179000'>direction u. So some unit
  vector.</span> </p><p><span m='184000'>Let me explain. Let's say that I have some</span>
  <span m='189000'>direction. For example,</span> <span m='191000'>the horizontal
  axis on this blackboard.</span> </p><p><span m='193000'>But it could be any direction
  in space.</span> </p><p><span m='196000'>And, to describe this direction, maybe
  I have a unit</span> <span m='201000'>vector along this axis. Let's say that I have
  any of a</span> <span m='206000'>vector A and I want to find out what is the component
  of A along</span> <span m='212000'>u. That means what is the length</span> <span
  m='216000'>of this projection of A to the given direction?</span> </p><p><span m='222000'>This
  thing here is the component of A along u.</span> </p><p><span m='235000'>Well, how
  do we find that? Well, we know that here we have</span> <span m='242000'>a right
  angle. So this component is just</span> <span m='247000'>length A times cosine of
  the angle between A and u.</span> </p><p><span m='253000'>But now that means I should
  be able to compute it very easily</span> <span m='258000'>because that's the same
  as length A times length u times</span> <span m='263000'>cosine theta because u
  is a unit vector.</span> </p><p><span m='267000'>It is a unit vector. That means
  this is equal to one.</span> </p><p><span m='273000'>And so that's the same as the
  dot product between A and u.</span> </p><p><span m='281000'>That is very easy. And,
  of course,</span> <span m='283000'>the most of just cases of that is say, for example,</span>
  <span m='287000'>we want just to find the component along i hat,</span> <span m='290000'>the
  unit vector along the x axis.</span> </p><p><span m='293000'>Then you do the dot
  product with i hat, which is 100.</span> </p><p><span m='297000'>What you get is
  the first component.</span> </p><p><span m='299000'>And that is, indeed, the x component
  of a</span> <span m='301000'>vector. Similarly, say you want the z</span> <span
  m='304000'>component you do the dot product with k that gives you the last</span>
  <span m='308000'>component of your vector. But the same works with a unit</span>
  <span m='314000'>vector in any direction. So what is an application of</span> <span
  m='321000'>that? Well, for example,</span> <span m='324000'>in physics maybe you
  have seen situations where you have a</span> <span m='330000'>pendulum that swings.
  You have maybe some mass at the</span> <span m='335000'>end of the string and that
  mass swings back and forth on a</span> <span m='341000'>circle. And to analyze this</span>
  <span m='342000'>mechanically you want to use, of course,</span> <span m='345000'>Newton's
  Laws of Mechanics and you want to use forces and so</span> <span m='350000'>on,
  but I claim that components of</span> <span m='354000'>vectors are useful here to
  understand what happens</span> <span m='359000'>geometrically. What are the forces
  exerted on</span> <span m='363000'>this pendulum? Well, there is its weight,</span>
  <span m='370000'>which usually points downwards, and there is the tension of the</span>
  <span m='381000'>string. And these two forces together</span> <span m='385000'>are
  what explains how this pendulum is going to move back</span> <span m='390000'>and
  forth. Now, you could try to</span> <span m='393000'>understand the equations of
  motion using x,</span> <span m='396000'>y coordinates or x, z or whatever you want
  to call</span> <span m='399000'>them, let's say x, y.</span> </p><p><span m='401000'>But
  really what causes the pendulum to swing back and forth</span> <span m='407000'>and
  also to somehow stay a constant distance are phenomenal</span> <span m='412000'>relative
  to this circular trajectory.</span> </p><p><span m='416000'>For example, maybe instead
  of taking</span> <span m='419000'>components along the x and y axis, we want to
  look at two</span> <span m='423000'>other unit vectors. We can look at a vector,</span>
  <span m='429000'>let's call it T, that is tangent to the</span> <span m='435000'>trajectory.
  Sorry. Can you read that?</span> </p><p><span m='438000'>It's not very readable.
  T is tangent to the trajectory.</span> </p><p><span m='453000'>And, on the other
  hand, we can introduce another</span> <span m='456000'>vector. Let's call that N.</span>
  </p><p><span m='462000'>And that one is normal, perpendicular to the</span> <span
  m='470000'>trajectory. And so now if you think about</span> <span m='475000'>it
  you can look at the components of the weight along</span> <span m='480000'>the tangent
  direction and along the normal direction.</span> </p><p><span m='486000'>And so
  the component of F along the tangent direction is what</span> <span m='493000'>causes
  acceleration in the direction along the trajectory.</span> </p><p><span m='501000'>It
  is what causes the pendulum to swing back and forth.</span> </p><p><span m='518000'>And
  the component along N, on the other hand.</span> </p><p><span m='525000'>That is
  the part of the weight that tends to pull our mass away</span> <span m='531000'>from
  this point. It is what is going to be</span> <span m='534000'>responsible for the
  tension of the string.</span> </p><p><span m='536000'>It is why the string is taut
  and not actually slack and with</span> <span m='542000'>things moving all over the
  place.</span> </p><p><span m='546000'>That one is responsible for the tension of
  a string.</span> </p><p><span m='558000'>And now, of course, if you want to compute
  things,</span> <span m='560000'>well, maybe you will call this angle theta and then
  you will</span> <span m='563000'>express things explicitly using sines and cosines
  and you will</span> <span m='567000'>solve for the equations of motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='569000'>That would be a very interesting physics problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='572000'>But, to save time, we are not going to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='575000'>I'm
  sure you've seen that in 8.01 or similar classes.</span> </p><p><span m='580000'>And
  so to find these components we will just do dot products.</span> </p><p><span m='588000'>Any
  questions? No.</span> </p><p><span m='596000'>OK. Let's move onto our next topic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='601000'>Here we have found things about lengths, angles and stuff
  like</span> <span m='606000'>that. One important concept that we</span> <span m='610000'>have
  not understood yet in terms of vectors is area.</span> </p><p><span m='617000'>Let's
  say that we want to find the area of this pentagon.</span> </p><p><span m='625000'>Well,
  how do we compute that using vectors?</span> </p><p><span m='628000'>Can we do it
  using vectors? Yes we can.</span> </p><p><span m='632000'>And that is going to be
  the goal.</span> </p><p><span m='636000'>The first thing we should do is probably
  simplify the problem.</span> </p><p><span m='642000'>We don't actually need to bother
  with pentagons.</span> </p><p><span m='644000'>All we need to know are triangles
  because,</span> <span m='648000'>for example, you can cut that in three</span> <span
  m='651000'>triangles and then sum the areas of the triangles.</span> </p><p><span
  m='656000'>Perhaps easier, what is the area of a triangle?</span> </p><p><span m='665000'>Let's
  start with a triangle in the plane.</span> </p><p><span m='672000'>Well, then we
  need two vectors to describe it,</span> <span m='676000'>say A and B here. How do
  we find the area of a</span> <span m='680000'>triangle? Well, we all know base times</span>
  <span m='683000'>height over two. What is the base?</span> </p><p><span m='685000'>What
  is the height? The area of this triangle is</span> <span m='690000'>going to be
  one-half of the base, which is going to be the</span> <span m='695000'>length of
  A. And the height,</span> <span m='699000'>well, if you call theta this angle, then
  this is length B</span> <span m='707000'>sine theta. Now, that looks a lot like
  the</span> <span m='711000'>formula we had there, except for one little catch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='714000'>This is a sine instead of a cosine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='718000'>How do we deal with that? Well, what we could do is first</span> <span
  m='723000'>find the cosine of the angle. We know how to find the cosine</span> <span
  m='730000'>of the angle using dot products. Then solve for sine using sine</span>
  <span m='737000'>square plus cosine square equals one.</span> </p><p><span m='742000'>And
  then plug that back into here.</span> </p><p><span m='745000'>Well, that works but
  it is kind of a very complicated way of</span> <span m='748000'>doing it. So there
  is an easier way.</span> </p><p><span m='750000'>And that is going to be determinants,</span>
  <span m='754000'>but let me explain how we get to that maybe still doing</span>
  <span m='760000'>elementary geometry and dot products first.</span> </p><p><span
  m='765000'>Let's see. What we can do is instead of</span> <span m='773000'>finding
  the sine of theta, well,</span> <span m='775000'>we're not good at finding sines
  of angles but we are very good</span> <span m='779000'>now at finding cosines of
  angles.</span> </p><p><span m='780000'>Maybe we can find another angle whose cosine
  is the same as the</span> <span m='785000'>sine of theta. Well, you have already
  heard</span> <span m='789000'>about complimentary angles and how I take my vector
  A,</span> <span m='794000'>my vector B here and I have an angle theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='798000'>Well, let's say that I rotate my vector A by 90 degrees to get</span>
  <span m='804000'>a new vector A prime. A prime is just A rotated by 90</span> <span
  m='814000'>degrees. Then the angle between these</span> <span m='819000'>two guys,
  let's say theta prime, well, theta prime is 90 degrees</span> <span m='825000'>or
  pi over two gradients minus theta.</span> </p><p><span m='829000'>So, in particular,
  cosine of theta prime is equal</span> <span m='836000'>to sine of theta. In particular,</span>
  <span m='841000'>that means that length A, length B, sine theta,</span> <span m='849000'>which
  is what we would need to know in order to find the area</span> <span m='853000'>of
  this triangle is equal to, well, A and A prime have the</span> <span m='857000'>same
  length so let me replace that by length of A prime.</span> </p><p><span m='861000'>I
  am not changing anything, length B, cosine theta prime.</span> </p><p><span m='868000'>And
  now we have something that is much easier for us.</span> </p><p><span m='871000'>Because
  that is just A prime dot B.</span> </p><p><span m='877000'>That looks like a very
  good plan.</span> </p><p><span m='880000'>There is only one small thing which is
  we don't know yet how</span> <span m='883000'>to find this A prime. Well, I think
  it is not very</span> <span m='888000'>hard. Let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='892000'>Actually,
  why don't you guys do the hard work?</span> </p><p><span m='898000'>Let's say that
  I have a plane vector A with two components a1,</span> <span m='902000'>a2. And
  I want to rotate it</span> <span m='905000'>counterclockwise by 90 degrees. It looks
  like maybe we should</span> <span m='910000'>change some signs somewhere. Maybe
  we should do something</span> <span m='914000'>with the components. Can you come
  up with an idea of</span> <span m='924000'>what it might be? I see a lot of people
  answering</span> <span m='934000'>three. I see some other answers,</span> <span
  m='937000'>but the majority vote seems to be number three.</span> </p><p><span m='941000'>Minus
  a2 and a1. I think I agree, so let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='949000'>Let's say
  that we have this vector A with components a1.</span> </p><p><span m='961000'>So
  a1 is here. And a2. So a2 is here.</span> </p><p><span m='965000'>Let's rotate this
  box by 90 degrees counterclockwise.</span> </p><p><span m='974000'>This box ends
  up there. It's the same box just flipped</span> <span m='979000'>on its side. This
  thing here becomes a1 and</span> <span m='983000'>this thing here becomes a2. And
  that means our new vector A</span> <span m='991000'>prime is going to be -- Well,
  the first component looks like</span> <span m='997000'>an a2 but it is pointing
  to the left when a2 is positive.</span> </p><p><span m='1000000'>So, actually, it
  is minus a2. And the y component is going to</span> <span m='1007000'>be the same
  as this guy, so it's going to be a1.</span> </p><p><span m='1013000'>If you wanted
  instead to rotate clockwise then you would do the</span> <span m='1016000'>opposite.
  You would do a2 minus a1.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>Is that reasonably clear
  for everyone?</span> </p><p><span m='1027000'>OK. Let's continue the calculation</span>
  <span m='1034000'>there. A prime, we have decided,</span> <span m='1038000'>is minus
  a2, a1 dot product with let's call</span> <span m='1044000'>b1 and b2, the components
  of B. Then that will be minus a2,</span> <span m='1053000'>b1 plus a1, b2 plus a1,
  b2.</span> </p><p><span m='1056000'>Let me write that the other way around, a1,
  b2 minus a2,</span> <span m='1063000'>b1. And that is a quantity that you</span>
  <span m='1066000'>may already know under the name of determinant of vectors A and</span>
  <span m='1073000'>B, which we write symbolically using this notation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1079000'>We put A and B next to each other inside a two-by-two table</span> <span
  m='1083000'>and we put these verticals bars. And that means the determinant</span>
  <span m='1089000'>of these numbers, this guy times this guy minus</span> <span m='1094000'>this
  guy times this guy. That is called the determinant.</span> </p><p><span m='1110000'>And
  geometrically what it measures is the area,</span> <span m='1114000'>well, not of
  a triangle because we did not divide by two,</span> <span m='1118000'>but of a parallelogram
  formed by A and B.</span> </p><p><span m='1122000'>It measures the area of the parallelogram
  with sides A and</span> <span m='1131000'>B. And, of course,</span> <span m='1133000'>if
  you want the triangle then you will just divide by two.</span> </p><p><span m='1136000'>The
  triangle is half the parallelogram.</span> </p><p><span m='1140000'>There is one
  small catch. The area usually is something</span> <span m='1144000'>that is going
  to be positive. This guy here has no reason to</span> <span m='1148000'>be positive
  or negative because, in fact, well,</span> <span m='1156000'>if you compute things
  you will see that where it is supposed to</span> <span m='1160000'>go negative it
  depends on whether A and B are clockwise or</span> <span m='1164000'>counterclockwise
  from each other.</span> </p><p><span m='1166000'>I mean the issue that we have --
  Well,</span> <span m='1169000'>when we say the area is one-half length A,</span>
  <span m='1171000'>length B, sine theta that was assuming</span> <span m='1174000'>that
  theta is positive, that its sine is positive.</span> </p><p><span m='1177000'>Otherwise,
  if theta is negative maybe we need to take the</span> <span m='1182000'>absolute
  value of this. Just to be more truthful,</span> <span m='1187000'>I will say the
  determinant is either plus or minus the area.</span> </p><p><span m='1196000'>Any
  questions about this? Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='1213000'>Sorry. That is not a
  dot product.</span> </p><p><span m='1215000'>That is the usual multiplication.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1218000'>That is length A times length B times sine theta.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1225000'>What does that equal? And so that is equal to the</span>
  <span m='1228000'>area of a parallelogram. Sorry.</span> </p><p><span m='1231000'>Let
  me explain that again. If I have two vectors A and B,</span> <span m='1239000'>I
  can form a parallelogram with them or I can form a triangle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1245000'>And so the area of a parallelogram is equal to length</span> <span m='1253000'>A,
  length B, sine theta, is equal to the determinant of</span> <span m='1260000'>A
  and B. While the area of a triangle is</span> <span m='1267000'>one-half of that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1281000'>And, again, to be truthful, I should say these things can</span>
  <span m='1285000'>be positive or negative. Depending on whether you count</span>
  <span m='1288000'>the angle positively or negatively, you will get either</span>
  <span m='1291000'>the area or minus the area. The area is actually the</span> <span
  m='1296000'>absolute value of these quantities.</span> </p><p><span m='1299000'>Is
  that clear? OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1309000'>Yes. If you want to compute the</span>
  <span m='1317000'>area, you will just take the absolute value of the</span> <span
  m='1319000'>determinant.</span> </p><p><span m='1335000'>I should say the area of
  a parallelogram so that it is</span> <span m='1339000'>completely clear. Sorry.
  Do you have a question?</span> </p><p><span m='1352000'>Explain again, sorry, was
  the question how a</span> <span m='1354000'>determinant equals the area of a parallelogram?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1358000'>OK. The area of a parallelogram is</span> <span m='1361000'>going
  to be the base times the height.</span> </p><p><span m='1365000'>Let's take this
  guy to be the base.</span> </p><p><span m='1368000'>The length of a base will be
  length of A and the height will</span> <span m='1373000'>be obtained by taking B
  but only looking at the vertical part.</span> </p><p><span m='1378000'>That will
  be length of B times the sine of theta.</span> </p><p><span m='1382000'>That is
  how I got the area of a parallelogram as length A,</span> <span m='1386000'>length
  B, sine theta. And then I did this</span> <span m='1389000'>manipulation and this
  trick of rotating to find a nice formula.</span> </p><p><span m='1395000'>Yes. You
  are asking ahead of what I</span> <span m='1403000'>am going to do in a few minutes.
  You are asking about magnitude</span> <span m='1408000'>of A cross B. We are going
  to learn about</span> <span m='1409000'>cross products in a few minutes. And the
  answer is yes,</span> <span m='1412000'>but cross product is for vectors in space.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1414000'>Here I was simplifying things by doing things just in the</span>
  <span m='1418000'>plane. Just bear with me for five more</span> <span m='1423000'>minutes
  and we will do things in space.</span> </p><p><span m='1428000'>Yes. That is correct.
  The way you compute this in</span> <span m='1435000'>practice is you just do this.
  That is how you compute the</span> <span m='1440000'>determinant. Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1444000'>What about three dimensions? Three dimensions we are going</span> <span
  m='1449000'>to do now. More questions?</span> </p><p><span m='1451000'>Should we
  move on? OK. Let's move to space.</span> </p><p><span m='1466000'>There are two
  things we can do in space.</span> </p><p><span m='1472000'>And you can look for
  the volume of solids or you can look for</span> <span m='1476000'>the area of surfaces.
  Let me start with the easier of</span> <span m='1479000'>the two. Let me start with
  volumes of</span> <span m='1482000'>solids. And we will go back to area,</span>
  <span m='1489000'>I promise. I claim that there is also a</span> <span m='1493000'>notion
  of determinants in space. And that is going to tell us</span> <span m='1499000'>how
  to find volumes. Let's say that we have three</span> <span m='1508000'>vectors A,
  B and C. And then the definition of</span> <span m='1516000'>their determinants
  going to be, the notation for that in terms</span> <span m='1523000'>of the components
  is the same as over there.</span> </p><p><span m='1528000'>We put the components
  of A, the components of B and the</span> <span m='1535000'>components of C inside
  verticals bars.</span> </p><p><span m='1540000'>And, of course, I have to give meaning
  to this.</span> </p><p><span m='1542000'>This will be a number. And what is that
  number?</span> </p><p><span m='1545000'>Well, the definition I will take is that
  this is a1 times</span> <span m='1550000'>the determinant of what I get by looking
  in this lower right</span> <span m='1555000'>corner. The two-by-two determinant
  b2,</span> <span m='1561000'>b3, c2, c3. Then I will subtract a2 times</span> <span
  m='1568000'>the determinant of b1, b3, c1, c3.</span> </p><p><span m='1575000'>And
  then I will add a3 times the determinant b1,</span> <span m='1582000'>b2, c1, c2.
  And each of these guys means,</span> <span m='1586000'>again, you take b2 times
  c3 minus c2 times b3 and this times</span> <span m='1590000'>that minus this time
  that and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='1593000'>In fact, there is a total of six
  terms in here.</span> </p><p><span m='1595000'>And maybe some of you have already
  seen a different formula</span> <span m='1599000'>for three-by-three determinants
  where you directly have the six</span> <span m='1602000'>terms. It is the same definition.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1607000'>How to remember the structure of this formula?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1610000'>Well, this is called an expansion according to the first</span> <span
  m='1615000'>row. So we are going to take the</span> <span m='1617000'>entries in
  the first row, a1, a2, a3 And for each of them</span> <span m='1622000'>we get the
  term. Namely we multiply it by a</span> <span m='1625000'>two-by-two determinant
  that we get by deleting the first row</span> <span m='1630000'>and the column where
  we are. Here the coefficient next to</span> <span m='1636000'>a1, when we delete
  this column and this row,</span> <span m='1641000'>we are left with b2, b3, c2,
  c3.</span> </p><p><span m='1644000'>The next one we take a2, we delete the row that
  is in it</span> <span m='1649000'>and the column that it is in. And we are left
  with b1,</span> <span m='1655000'>b3, c1, c3. And, similarly,</span> <span m='1658000'>with
  a3, we take what remains, which is b1,</span> <span m='1661000'>b2, c1, c2. Finally,
  last but not least,</span> <span m='1665000'>there is a minus sign here for the
  second guy.</span> </p><p><span m='1671000'>It looks like a weird formula. I mean
  it is a little bit weird.</span> </p><p><span m='1681000'>But it is a formula that
  you should learn because it is</span> <span m='1684000'>really, really useful for
  a lot of things.</span> </p><p><span m='1686000'>I should say if this looks very
  artificial to you and you would</span> <span m='1690000'>like to know more there
  is more in the notes,</span> <span m='1694000'>so read the notes. They will tell
  you a bit more</span> <span m='1697000'>about what this means, where it comes from
  and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='1700000'>If you want to know a lot more then some
  day you should take</span> <span m='1703000'>18.06, Linear Algebra where you will</span>
  <span m='1706000'>learn a lot more about determinants in N dimensional</span> <span
  m='1709000'>space with N vectors. And there is a generalization</span> <span m='1712000'>of
  this in arbitrary dimensions. In this class,</span> <span m='1716000'>we will only
  deal with two or three dimensions.</span> </p><p><span m='1719000'>Yes. Why is the
  negative there?</span> </p><p><span m='1724000'>Well, that is a very good question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1725000'>It has to be there so that this will actually equal,</span>
  <span m='1729000'>well, what I am going to say right now is that this will give</span>
  <span m='1733000'>us the volume of [a box?] with sides A,</span> <span m='1735000'>B,
  C. And the formula just doesn't</span> <span m='1737000'>work if you don't put the
  negative.</span> </p><p><span m='1739000'>There is a more fundamental reason which
  has to do with</span> <span m='1742000'>orientation of space and the fact that if
  you switch two</span> <span m='1746000'>coordinates in space then basically you
  change what is</span> <span m='1749000'>called the handedness of the coordinates.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1752000'>If you look at your right hand and your left hand,</span>
  <span m='1754000'>they are not actually the same. They are mirror images.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1756000'>And, if you squared two coordinate axes,</span> <span m='1758000'>that
  is what you get. That is the fundamental reason</span> <span m='1761000'>for the
  minus. Again, we don't need to think</span> <span m='1764000'>too much about that.
  All we need in this class is</span> <span m='1773000'>the formula. Why do we care
  about this</span> <span m='1778000'>formula? It is because of the theorem</span>
  <span m='1783000'>that says that geometrically the determinant of the three vectors</span>
  <span m='1792000'>A, B, C is, again, plus or minus.</span> </p><p><span m='1798000'>This
  determinant could be positive or negative.</span> </p><p><span m='1800000'>See those
  minuses and all sorts of stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='1803000'>Plus or minus the
  volume of the parallelepiped.</span> </p><p><span m='1814000'>That is just a fancy
  name for a box with parallelogram sides,</span> <span m='1820000'>in case you wonder,
  with sides A,</span> <span m='1824000'>B and C. You take the three vectors A,</span>
  <span m='1829000'>B and C and you form a box whose sides are all</span> <span m='1835000'>parallelograms.
  And when its volume is going to</span> <span m='1844000'>be the determinant. Other
  questions?</span> </p><p><span m='1859000'>I'm sorry. I cannot quite hear you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1871000'>Yes. We are going to see how to do</span> <span m='1872000'>it
  geometrically without a determinant,</span> <span m='1874000'>but then you will
  see that you actually need a determinant to</span> <span m='1877000'>compute it
  no matter what. We are going to go back to this</span> <span m='1881000'>and see
  another formula for volume, but you will see that</span> <span m='1884000'>really
  I am cheating. I mean somehow computationally</span> <span m='1886000'>the only
  way to compute it is really to use a determinant.</span> </p><p><span m='1903000'>That
  is correct. In general, I mean,</span> <span m='1904000'>actually, I could say if
  you look at the two-by-two</span> <span m='1907000'>determinant, see, you can also
  explain it in</span> <span m='1910000'>terms of this extension. If you take a1 and
  multiply by</span> <span m='1914000'>this one-by-one determinant b2, then you take
  a2 and you</span> <span m='1917000'>multiply it by this one-by-one determinant b1
  but you put a</span> <span m='1920000'>minus sign. And in general,</span> <span
  m='1922000'>indeed, when you expand, you would stop putting plus,</span> <span m='1926000'>minus,
  plus, minus alternating.</span> </p><p><span m='1928000'>More about that in 18.06.
  Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='1935000'>There is a way to do it based on other rows
  as well,</span> <span m='1938000'>but then you have to be very careful with the
  sign vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='1940000'>I will refer you to the notes for
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='1943000'>I mean you could also do it with a column,</span>
  <span m='1945000'>by the way. I mean be careful about the</span> <span m='1948000'>sign
  rules. Given how little we will use</span> <span m='1950000'>determinants in this
  class, I mean we will use them in a</span> <span m='1953000'>way that is fundamental,
  but we won't compute much.</span> </p><p><span m='1956000'>Let's say this is going
  to be enough for us for now.</span> </p><p><span m='1967000'>After determinants
  now I can tell you about cross product.</span> </p><p><span m='1970000'>And cross
  product is going to be the answer to your question</span> <span m='1973000'>about
  area.</span> </p><p><span m='2012000'>OK. Let me move onto cross product.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2025000'>Cross product is something that you can apply to two vectors
  in</span> <span m='2033000'>space. And by that I mean really in</span> <span m='2036000'>three-dimensional
  space. This is something that is</span> <span m='2039000'>specific to three dimensions.
  The definition A cross B -- It</span> <span m='2045000'>is important to really do
  your multiplication symbol well so</span> <span m='2051000'>that you don't mistake
  it with a dot product.</span> </p><p><span m='2056000'>Well, that is going to be
  a vector.</span> </p><p><span m='2063000'>That is another reason not to confuse
  it with dot product.</span> </p><p><span m='2066000'>Dot product gives you a number.
  Cross product gives you a</span> <span m='2070000'>vector. They are really completely</span>
  <span m='2072000'>different operations. They are both called product</span> <span
  m='2075000'>because someone could not come up with a better name,</span> <span m='2078000'>but
  they are completely different operations.</span> </p><p><span m='2082000'>What do
  we do to do the cross product of A and B?</span> </p><p><span m='2085000'>Well,
  we do something very strange.</span> </p><p><span m='2087000'>Just as I have told
  you that a determinant is something where</span> <span m='2090000'>we put numbers
  and we get a number, I am going to violate my</span> <span m='2094000'>own rule.
  I am going to put together a</span> <span m='2099000'>determinant in which -- Well,
  the last two rows are the</span> <span m='2106000'>components of the vectors A and
  B but the first row strangely</span> <span m='2111000'>consists for unit vectors
  i, j, k.</span> </p><p><span m='2115000'>What does that mean? Well, that is not
  a determinant</span> <span m='2119000'>in the usual sense. If you try to put that
  into</span> <span m='2121000'>your calculator, it will tell you there is an</span>
  <span m='2124000'>error. I don't know how to put vectors</span> <span m='2126000'>in
  there. I want numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='2128000'>What is means is it is symbolic
  notation that helps you remember</span> <span m='2132000'>what the formula is. The
  actual formula is,</span> <span m='2135000'>well, you use this definition. And,
  if you use that</span> <span m='2140000'>definition, you see that it is i hat times
  some number.</span> </p><p><span m='2147000'>Let me write it as determinant of a2,
  a3, b2,</span> <span m='2155000'>b3 times i hat minus determinant a1,</span> <span
  m='2162000'>a3, b1, b3, j hat plus a1, a2, b1, b2, k hat.</span> </p><p><span m='2171000'>And
  so that is the actual definition in a way that makes</span> <span m='2175000'>complete
  sense, but to remember this formula</span> <span m='2178000'>without too much trouble
  it is much easier to think about it in</span> <span m='2183000'>these terms here.
  That is the definition and it</span> <span m='2187000'>gives you a vector. Now,
  as usual with definitions,</span> <span m='2190000'>the question is what is it good
  for?</span> </p><p><span m='2192000'>What is the geometric meaning of this very
  strange operation?</span> </p><p><span m='2196000'>Why do we bother to do that?
  Here is what it does</span> <span m='2208000'>geometrically. Remember a vector has
  two</span> <span m='2212000'>different things. It has a length and it has a</span>
  <span m='2216000'>direction. Let's start with the length.</span> </p><p><span m='2221000'>A
  length of a cross product is the area of the parallelogram in</span> <span m='2235000'>space
  formed by the vectors A and B.</span> </p><p><span m='2244000'>Now, if you have
  a parallelogram in space,</span> <span m='2247000'>you can find its area just by
  doing this calculation when you</span> <span m='2251000'>know the coordinates of
  the points.</span> </p><p><span m='2253000'>You do this calculation and then you
  take the length.</span> </p><p><span m='2255000'>You take this squared plus that
  squared plus that squared,</span> <span m='2260000'>square root. It looks like a
  very</span> <span m='2263000'>complicated formula but it works and, actually,</span>
  <span m='2267000'>it is the simplest way to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='2269000'>This
  time we don't actually need to put plus or minus</span> <span m='2272000'>because
  the length of a vector is always positive.</span> </p><p><span m='2275000'>We don't
  have to worry about that.</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>And what is even more
  magical is that not only is the length</span> <span m='2284000'>remarkable but the
  direction is also remarkable.</span> </p><p><span m='2287000'>The direction of A
  cross B is perpendicular to the plane of a</span> <span m='2304000'>parallelogram.
  Our two vectors A and B</span> <span m='2313000'>together in a plane. What I am
  telling you is that</span> <span m='2321000'>for vector A cross B will point, will
  stick straight out of that</span> <span m='2331000'>plane perpendicularly to it.
  In fact, I would have to be</span> <span m='2336000'>more precise. There are two
  ways that you can</span> <span m='2338000'>be perpendicular to this plane. You can
  be perpendicular</span> <span m='2342000'>pointing up or pointing down. How do I
  decide which?</span> </p><p><span m='2346000'>Well, there is something called the
  right-hand rule.</span> </p><p><span m='2356000'>What does the right-hand rule say?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2358000'>Well, there are various versions for right-hand rule</span>
  <span m='2361000'>depending on which country you learn about it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2363000'>In France, given the culture, you even learn about it in</span> <span
  m='2366000'>terms of a cork screw and a wine bottle.</span> </p><p><span m='2368000'>I
  will just use the usual version here.</span> </p><p><span m='2373000'>You take your
  right hand. If you are left-handed,</span> <span m='2375000'>remember to take your
  right hand and not the left one.</span> </p><p><span m='2378000'>The other right,
  OK? Then place your hand to point</span> <span m='2383000'>in the direction of A.
  Let's say my right hand is</span> <span m='2386000'>going in that direction. Now,
  curl your fingers so that</span> <span m='2390000'>they point towards B. Here that
  would be kind of into</span> <span m='2394000'>the blackboard. Don't snap any bones.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2396000'>If it doesn't quite work then rotate your arms so that
  you can</span> <span m='2400000'>actually physically do it. Then get your thumb
  to stick</span> <span m='2404000'>straight out. Well, here my thumb is going to</span>
  <span m='2407000'>go up. And that tells me that A cross</span> <span m='2411000'>B
  will go up. Let me write that down while</span> <span m='2416000'>you experiment
  with it. Again, try not to enjoy</span> <span m='2419000'>yourselves.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2430000'>First, your right hand points parallel to vector A.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2439000'>Then your fingers point in the direction of B.</span> </p><p><span m='2447000'>Then
  your thumb, when you stick it out,</span> <span m='2453000'>is going to point in
  the direction of A cross B.</span> </p><p><span m='2460000'>Let's do a quick example.
  Where is my quick example? Here.</span> </p><p><span m='2489000'>Let's take i cross
  j.</span> </p><p><span m='2500000'>I see most of you going in the right direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2507000'>If you have it pointing in the wrong direction,</span>
  <span m='2511000'>it might mean that you are using your left hand,</span> <span
  m='2516000'>for example. Example, I claim that i cross j</span> <span m='2521000'>equals
  k. Let's see. I points towards us.</span> </p><p><span m='2527000'>J point to our
  right. I guess this is your right.</span> </p><p><span m='2532000'>I think. And
  then your thumb is going to</span> <span m='2536000'>point up. That tells us it
  is roughly</span> <span m='2539000'>pointing up. And, of course,</span> <span m='2541000'>the
  length should be one because if you take the unit</span> <span m='2544000'>square
  in the x, y plane, its area is one.</span> </p><p><span m='2547000'>And the direction
  should be vertical.</span> </p><p><span m='2549000'>Because it should be perpendicular
  to the x,</span> <span m='2554000'>y plane. It looks like i cross j will be</span>
  <span m='2557000'>k. Well, let's check with the</span> <span m='2561000'>definition
  i, j, k.</span> </p><p><span m='2563000'>What is i? I is one, zero, zero. J is zero,
  one, zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2571000'>The coefficient of i will be zero times
  zero minus zero times</span> <span m='2578000'>one. That is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2580000'>The coefficient of j will be one time zero minus zero times</span> <span
  m='2584000'>zero, that is a zero, minus zero j.</span> </p><p><span m='2586000'>It
  doesn't matter. And the coefficient of k will</span> <span m='2591000'>be one times
  one, that is one,</span> <span m='2594000'>minus zero times zero, so one k.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2597000'>So we do get i cross j equals k both ways.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2602000'>In this case, it is easier to do it</span> <span m='2604000'>geometrically.
  If I give you no complicated</span> <span m='2607000'>vectors, probably you will
  actually want to do the</span> <span m='2612000'>calculation. Any questions? Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2621000'>The coefficient of k, remember I delete the first row</span>
  <span m='2625000'>and the last column so I get this two-by-two determinant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2630000'>And that two-by-two determinant is one times one minus
  zero</span> <span m='2634000'>times zero so that gives me a one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2636000'>That is what you do with two-by-two determinants.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2639000'>Similarly for [UNINTELLIGIBLE], but [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</span> <span m='2643000'>turn
  out to be zero. More questions?</span> </p><p><span m='2651000'>Yes. Let me repeat
  how I got the one</span> <span m='2654000'>in front of k. Remember the definition
  of a</span> <span m='2658000'>determinant I expand according to the entries in the
  first row.</span> </p><p><span m='2664000'>When I get to k what I do is delete the
  first row and I</span> <span m='2668000'>delete the last column, the column that
  contains k.</span> </p><p><span m='2672000'>I delete these guys and these guys and
  I am left with this</span> <span m='2677000'>two-by-two determinant. Now, a two-by-two
  determinant,</span> <span m='2681000'>you multiply according to this downward diagonal
  and then minus</span> <span m='2687000'>this times that. One times one,</span> <span
  m='2690000'>let me see here, I got one k because that is one</span> <span m='2695000'>times
  one minus zero times zero equals one.</span> </p><p><span m='2700000'>Sorry. That
  is really hard to read.</span> </p><p><span m='2703000'>Maybe it will be easier
  that way.</span> </p><p><span m='2711000'>Yes. Let's try.</span> </p><p><span m='2719000'>If
  I do the same for i, I think I will also get zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2723000'>Let's
  do the same for i. I take i, I delete the first</span> <span m='2728000'>row, I
  delete the first column, I get this two-by-two</span> <span m='2733000'>determinant
  here and I get zero times zero,</span> <span m='2736000'>that is zero, minus zero
  times one.</span> </p><p><span m='2739000'>That is the other trick question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2743000'>Zero times one is zero as well. So that zero minus zero
  is</span> <span m='2749000'>zero. I hope on Monday you should get</span> <span m='2752000'>more
  practice in recitation about how to compute</span> <span m='2755000'>determinants.
  Hopefully, it will become very</span> <span m='2758000'>easy for you all to compute
  this next.</span> </p><p><span m='2761000'>I know the first time it is kind of a
  shock because there</span> <span m='2764000'>are a lot of numbers and a lot of things
  to do.</span> </p><p><span m='2822000'>Let me return to the question that you asked
  a bit earlier</span> <span m='2828000'>about how do you find actually volume if
  I don't want to know</span> <span m='2833000'>about determinants? Well, let's have
  another look</span> <span m='2844000'>at the volume. Let's say that I have three</span>
  <span m='2851000'>vectors. Let me put them this way,</span> <span m='2857000'>A,
  B and C. And let's try to see how else I</span> <span m='2863000'>could think about
  the volume of this box.</span> </p><p><span m='2869000'>Probably you know that the
  volume of a parallelepiped is</span> <span m='2874000'>the area of a base times
  the height.</span> </p><p><span m='2877000'>Sorry. The volume is the area of a</span>
  <span m='2884000'>base times the height. How do we do that in practice?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2892000'>Well, what is the area of a base?</span> </p><p><span m='2895000'>The
  base is a parallelogram in space with sides B and C.</span> </p><p><span m='2901000'>How
  do we find the area of the parallelogram in space?</span> </p><p><span m='2903000'>Well,
  we just discovered that. We can do it by taking that</span> <span m='2908000'>cross
  product. The area of a base,</span> <span m='2910000'>well, we take the cross product
  of B and C.</span> </p><p><span m='2913000'>That is not quite it because this is
  a vector.</span> </p><p><span m='2916000'>We would like a number while we take its
  length.</span> </p><p><span m='2920000'>That is pretty good. What about the height?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2924000'>Well, the height is going to be the component of A in the</span>
  <span m='2928000'>direction that is perpendicular to the base.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2931000'>Let's take a direction that is perpendicular to the base.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2933000'>Let's call that N, a unit vector in that</span> <span m='2937000'>direction.
  Then we can get the height by</span> <span m='2940000'>taking A dot n. That is what
  we saw at the</span> <span m='2944000'>beginning of class that A dot n will tell
  me how much A goes in</span> <span m='2950000'>the direction of n. Are you still
  with me?</span> </p><p><span m='2957000'>OK. Let's keep going.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2962000'>Let's think about this vector n.</span> </p><p><span m='2964000'>How
  do I get it? Well, I can get it by actually</span> <span m='2969000'>using cross
  product as well. Because I said the direction</span> <span m='2974000'>perpendicular
  to two vectors I can get by taking that cross</span> <span m='2977000'>product and
  looking at that direction.</span> </p><p><span m='2980000'>This is still B cross
  C length. And this one is,</span> <span m='2987000'>so I claim, n can be obtained
  by taking D cross C.</span> </p><p><span m='2996000'>Well, that comes in the right
  direction but it is not a unit</span> <span m='2998000'>vector. How do I get a unit
  vector?</span> </p><p><span m='3001000'>I divide by the length. Thanks.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3006000'>I take B cross C and I divide by length B cross C.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3014000'>Well, now I can probably simplify between these two guys.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3020000'>And so what I will get -- What I get out of this is that my</span> <span
  m='3038000'>volume equals A dot product with vector B cross C.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3053000'>But, of course, I have to be careful in which</span> <span m='3055000'>order
  I do it. If I do it the other way</span> <span m='3056000'>around, A dot B, I get
  a number.</span> </p><p><span m='3058000'>I cannot cross that. I really have to
  do the cross</span> <span m='3060000'>product first. I get the new vector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3063000'>Then my dot product. The fact is that the</span> <span
  m='3069000'>determinant of A, B, C is equal to this so-called</span> <span m='3076000'>triple
  product. Well, that looks good</span> <span m='3080000'>geometrically. Let's try
  to check whether it</span> <span m='3083000'>makes sense with the formulas, just
  one small thing.</span> </p><p><span m='3087000'>We saw the determinant is a1 times
  determinant b2,</span> <span m='3092000'>b3, c2, c3 minus a2 times something plus
  a3 times</span> <span m='3097000'>something. I will let you fill in the</span> <span
  m='3102000'>numbers. That is this guy.</span> </p><p><span m='3105000'>What about
  this guy? Well, dot product,</span> <span m='3108000'>we take the first component
  of A, that is a1,</span> <span m='3110000'>we multiply by the first component of
  B cross C.</span> </p><p><span m='3113000'>What is the first component of B cross
  C?</span> </p><p><span m='3115000'>Well, it is this determinant b2, b3, c2, c3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3125000'>If you put B and C instead of A and B into there you will
  get</span> <span m='3129000'>the i component is this guy plus a2 times the second
  component</span> <span m='3134000'>which is minus some determinant plus a3 times
  the third</span> <span m='3138000'>component which is, again, a determinant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3142000'>And you can check. You get exactly the same</span> <span
  m='3144000'>expression, so everything is fine.</span> </p><p><span m='3146000'>There
  is no contradiction in math just yet.</span> </p><p><span m='3152000'>On Tuesday
  we will continue with this and we will start</span> <span m='3158000'>going into
  matrices, equations of planes and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='3163000'>Meanwhile,
  have a good weekend and please start working on your</span> <span m='3166000'>Problem
  Sets so that you can ask lots of questions to your TAs on</span> <span m='3169000'>Monday.</span>
