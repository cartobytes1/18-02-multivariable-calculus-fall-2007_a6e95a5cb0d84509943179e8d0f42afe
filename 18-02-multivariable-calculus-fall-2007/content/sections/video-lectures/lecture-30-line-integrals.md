  <span m='24000'>The other thing is the last lecture before the break ended a</span>
  <span m='28000'>bit abruptly because I ran out of time,</span> <span m='31000'>so
  just to summarize what the main point was,</span> <span m='34000'>I mean probably
  you figured this out if you looked at the</span> <span m='37000'>notes. It is not
  that important,</span> <span m='39000'>but anyway. I just wanted to remind you,</span>
  <span m='43000'>just to clarify what happened at the end, we got the diffusion</span>
  <span m='48000'>equation from two bits of information.</span> <span m='52000'>I
  mean the unknown, in this partial differential</span> <span m='55000'>equation,
  is a function that we call u that corresponds to the</span> <span m='59000'>concentration
  of some substance. And we used a vector field that</span> <span m='64000'>represents
  the flow of whatever the substance is whose diffusion</span> <span m='72000'>we
  are studying. And so we got two bits of</span> <span m='77000'>information, one
  that came from physics that said the flow goes</span> <span m='85000'>from high
  concentration to smaller concentration.</span> <span m='91000'>And that told us
  that the flow is proportional to a negative</span> <span m='97000'>gradient of a
  concentration. And the second piece of</span> <span m='102000'>information that
  we got was from the divergence theorem,</span> <span m='106000'>and that was the
  one I spent time trying to explain.</span> <span m='110000'>And that one told us
  that the divergence of F is actually</span> <span m='117000'>negative partial u
  over partial t.</span> <span m='122000'>When you combine these two relations together
  that is how</span> <span m='127000'>you get the diffusion equation. Sorry, I should
  say this is not</span> <span m='131000'>the statement of a divergence theorem.</span>
  <span m='132000'>This is something that would derive from it with quite a few</span>
  <span m='137000'>steps involved. And so what we got out of that</span> <span m='141000'>is
  a diffusion equation because we end up getting that partial u</span> <span m='147000'>over
  partial t is minus div F, which is therefore positive k</span> <span m='153000'>times
  divergence of grad u, which is what we denoted by del</span> <span m='159000'>square
  u, the Laplacian.</span> <span m='162000'>So, that is how we got the diffusion equation.</span>
  <span m='179000'>Anyway, I will let you have a look at the notes that were</span>
  <span m='184000'>handed out in case you really want to see more.</span> <span m='188000'>I
  just wanted to give the missing part of the last</span> <span m='196000'>lecture.
  Let me just switch gears</span> <span m='199000'>completely and switch to today's
  topic, which is line integrals</span> <span m='204000'>and work in 3D. That is going
  to look a lot</span> <span m='207000'>like what we did in the plane, except, of
  course,</span> <span m='209000'>there is a z coordinate. You will see it doesn't
  change</span> <span m='212000'>things much when it comes to computing a line integral.</span>
  <span m='215000'>It changes things quite a bit, however, when it comes to</span>
  <span m='219000'>testing whether a field is a gradient field.</span> <span m='222000'>That
  is why we have to be more careful.</span> <span m='225000'>Let's start right away
  with line integrals in space.</span> <span m='237000'>Let's say that we have a vector
  field F with components P,</span> <span m='248000'>Q and R. We should think of it
  maybe as</span> <span m='252000'>representing a force. And let's say that we have
  a</span> <span m='258000'>curve C in space. Then the work done by the field</span>
  <span m='264000'>will be the line integral along C of F dot dr.</span> <span m='269000'>That
  is a familiar formula. And what we do with that</span> <span m='274000'>formula
  is also familiar, except now, of course,</span> <span m='277000'>we have a z coordinate.
  We are going to think of vector</span> <span m='284000'>dr as a space vector with
  components dx,</span> <span m='290000'>dy and dz. When we do the dot product of
  F</span> <span m='296000'>with dr that will tell us that we have to integrate Pdx
  Qdy</span> <span m='304000'>Rdz. But it is still a line integral</span> <span m='307000'>so
  it is still going to turn into a single integral when you</span> <span m='312000'>plug
  in the correct values. So the method will be exactly</span> <span m='316000'>the
  same as in the plane, namely we will find some way to</span> <span m='319000'>parameterize
  our curve, x plus x, y z in terms of a</span> <span m='322000'>single variable,
  and then we will integrate with</span> <span m='330000'>respect to that variable.
  The way that we evaluate is by</span> <span m='344000'>parameterizing C and express
  x, y, z, dx, dy,</span> <span m='356000'>dz in terms of the parameter. Let's do
  an example just to</span> <span m='367000'>convince you that you actually know how
  to do this,</span> <span m='369000'>or at least you should know how to do this.</span>
  <span m='372000'>Let's say that I give you the vector field with components yz,</span>
  <span m='381000'>xz and xy. And let's say that we have a</span> <span m='387000'>curve
  given by x equals t^3, y equals t^2,</span> <span m='393000'>z equals t for t going
  from zero to one.</span> <span m='400000'>The way we will set up the line integral
  for the work done will</span> <span m='405000'>be -- Well, sorry. Before we actually
  set up the</span> <span m='409000'>line integral, we need to know how we will</span>
  <span m='411000'>express everything in terms of t and dt.</span> <span m='414000'>x,
  y and z, in terms of t, are given here.</span> <span m='416000'>We just need to
  do also dx, dy and dz.</span> <span m='421000'>By differentiating you get dx is
  3t^2 dt.</span> <span m='425000'>That is the derivative of t^3, dy will be 2t dt
  and dz will</span> <span m='434000'>just be dt. And we will evaluate the line</span>
  <span m='443000'>integral for work. That will be the integral of yz</span> <span
  m='456000'>dx xz dy xy dz, which will become -- yz is t^3</span> <span m='468000'>times
  dx is 3t^2 dt plus xz is t^4 times dy is 2t dt plus xy is</span> <span m='484000'>t^5
  dt. That just becomes the integral</span> <span m='488000'>from, well, I guess t
  goes from zero to one, actually.</span> <span m='491000'>And we are integrating
  three plus two plus one.</span> <span m='494000'>That is 6t^5 dt which, I am sure
  you know,</span> <span m='502000'>integrates to t^6, so we will just get one.</span>
  <span m='510000'>It is the same method as usual. And if you are being given a</span>
  <span m='513000'>geometric description of a curve then, of course,</span> <span
  m='516000'>you will have to decide for yourself what the best parameter</span> <span
  m='519000'>will be. It might be some time parameter</span> <span m='523000'>t like
  here. It might be one of the</span> <span m='525000'>coordinates. Here we could
  have used z as</span> <span m='529000'>our parameter because, in fact, this curve
  is x equals</span> <span m='533000'>x3 and y equals z2. And we could also have used</span>
  <span m='537000'>maybe some angle. Well, not here,</span> <span m='539000'>but if
  we had been moving on a circle or something like that.</span> <span m='544000'>Any
  questions so far? No.</span> <span m='551000'>OK. Well,</span> <span m='566000'>because
  we can do a bit more practice,</span> <span m='571000'>let's do another one where
  we do the same vector field F but</span> <span m='580000'>our curve C will be going
  from the origin to the point (1,0,</span> <span m='589000'>0) along the x-axis.
  Let's call that C1.</span> <span m='594000'>Then to (1,1, 0). Let's call that C2
  by moving</span> <span m='602000'>parallel to the y-axis. And then up to (1,1,</span>
  <span m='608000'>1) parallel to the z-axis, let's call that C3.</span> <span m='614000'>I
  am sure that some of you at least are suspecting what I am</span> <span m='619000'>getting
  at here, but let's not spoil it for</span> <span m='623000'>those who don't see
  it yet. OK.</span> <span m='627000'>If we want to compute the line integral along
  this guy then we</span> <span m='633000'>have to break it into a sum of three terms.</span>
  <span m='638000'>Well, maybe I should call that C', not C, because that is not</span>
  <span m='642000'>the same C anymore. I want to do the sum of the</span> <span m='648000'>line
  integrals along C1, C2 and C3.</span> <span m='655000'>And, well, if I look at C1
  and C2 they take place inside the x,</span> <span m='673000'>y plane. In fact, you
  know that z will</span> <span m='679000'>be zero and dz will also be zero on both
  of these.</span> <span m='685000'>And if you just look at the formula for line integral
  in the</span> <span m='690000'>role of yz dx plus xz dy plus xy dz,</span> <span
  m='694000'>well, it looks like if you plug z equals zero and dz equals zero</span>
  <span m='697000'>you will just get zero. These are actually very fast.</span> <span
  m='707000'>Let me write it. This is going to be zero,</span> <span m='720000'>this
  is going to be zero, this is going to zero,</span> <span m='724000'>and we will
  get zero. Now, if we do C3,</span> <span m='727000'>well, there we might have to
  do some calculation,</span> <span m='731000'>but it won't be all that bad. C3, well,
  x and y are both</span> <span m='738000'>equal to one. And, of course,</span> <span
  m='742000'>because they are constant that means dx is zero and dy is zero.</span>
  <span m='746000'>On the other hand, z varies from zero to one.</span> <span m='755000'>If
  I look at the line integral on C3 -- The first two terms,</span> <span m='762000'>yz,
  dx and xz dy go away because the dx and dy are zero,</span> <span m='768000'>so
  I am just left with xy dz. But because x and y are one it</span> <span m='775000'>is
  just the integral of dz from zero to one, and that will just</span> <span m='781000'>end
  up being one. If add these numbers together,</span> <span m='787000'>zero plus zero
  plus one, I get one again.</span> <span m='793000'>And, of course, it is not a coincidence
  because</span> <span m='795000'>this vector field is a gradient field.</span> <span
  m='798000'>I am sure some of you have already figured out what it is</span> <span
  m='800000'>the gradient of. Otherwise, we will figure it</span> <span m='804000'>out
  together. And so that is why we get the</span> <span m='808000'>same answer for
  these two paths going both from the origin to</span> <span m='813000'>(1,1, 1).
  Maybe I should point out,</span> <span m='816000'>to make it clear, that if you
  plug t equals zero</span> <span m='820000'>in up there you will get (0,0, 0).</span>
  <span m='822000'>If you plug t equals one, you will get (1,1,</span> <span m='825000'>1).
  In fact -- F that we have here</span> <span m='836000'>happens to be conservative.
  And, if you plug the two curves</span> <span m='851000'>together -- Well, I am not
  really sure if I know</span> <span m='860000'>how to plot this correctly. It is
  not exactly how it looks.</span> <span m='868000'>Whatever. The first curve C goes
  from the</span> <span m='873000'>origin to this point, and so does C ',</span> <span
  m='879000'>just in a slightly more roundabout way.</span> <span m='885000'>They
  both go from the origin to (1,1, 1).</span> <span m='891000'>It is not a surprise
  that you will get the same answer for</span> <span m='900000'>both line integrals.
  And how do we see that?</span> <span m='905000'>Well, actually here it is not very
  hard to find a function</span> <span m='911000'>whose gradient is this vector field.</span>
  <span m='915000'>Namely, the gradient of x, y, z looks like it should be</span>
  <span m='921000'>exactly what we want. If you take partial of this</span> <span
  m='926000'>with respect to x, you will get yz,</span> <span m='929000'>then with
  respect to y, xz, and with respect to z,</span> <span m='933000'>xy. And so, in
  fact,</span> <span m='935000'>what was the easier way to compute these line integrals
  was</span> <span m='938000'>to use the fundamental theorem of calculus.</span> <span
  m='941000'>Once we have this remark, we don't need to compute these</span> <span
  m='945000'>line integrals anymore. We can just use the fundamental</span> <span
  m='956000'>theorem. If we know this fundamental</span> <span m='968000'>theorem
  -- -- for line integrals,</span> <span m='980000'>that tells us that the line integral
  of a gradient field is</span> <span m='987000'>equal to the value of the potential
  at the final point</span> <span m='993000'>minus the value of the potential at the
  starting point.</span> <span m='1000000'>And that, of course, only applies if you
  have a</span> <span m='1003000'>potential. So, in particular,</span> <span m='1006000'>only
  if you have a conservative field, a gradient field.</span> <span m='1012000'>Here,
  in our example, we have to look at,</span> <span m='1018000'>let's call little f
  of x, y, z that potential xyz,</span> <span m='1026000'>then we take f(1,1, 1) -
  f(0,0, 0).</span> <span m='1032000'>And that indeed is one minus zero which is one.</span>
  <span m='1037000'>Everything is consistent. All this stuff so far works</span> <span
  m='1044000'>exactly as in the plane. Any questions?</span> <span m='1052000'>No.
  OK.</span> <span m='1055000'>Let's try to see where things do get a little bit different.</span>
  <span m='1060000'>And the first such place is when we try to test whether a</span>
  <span m='1064000'>vector field is a gradient field.</span> <span m='1067000'>Remember
  when we had a vector field in the plane,</span> <span m='1073000'>to know whether
  it was a gradient of a function of two</span> <span m='1076000'>variables we just
  had to check one condition,</span> <span m='1079000'>N sub x equals M sub y. Now
  we actually have three</span> <span m='1084000'>different conditions to check, and
  that means,</span> <span m='1086000'>of course, more work.</span> <span m='1103000'>OK.
  So what is our test for</span> <span m='1114000'>gradient fields? We want to know
  whether a given</span> <span m='1124000'>vector field with components P, Q and R
  can be written as f sub</span> <span m='1130000'>x, f sub y and f sub z for a same
  function F.</span> <span m='1135000'>And for that to possibly happen, well,</span>
  <span m='1139000'>we need certainly some relations between P,</span> <span m='1143000'>Q
  and R. And, as before,</span> <span m='1145000'>this comes from the fact that the
  mixed second derivatives are</span> <span m='1151000'>the same, no matter in which
  order you take them.</span> <span m='1156000'>If that is the case then I can compute
  f sub xy,</span> <span m='1161000'>which is the same as f sub yx in two different
  ways.</span> <span m='1168000'>F sub xy should be P sub y. F sub yx, well,</span>
  <span m='1175000'>since f sub y is Q, that should be Q sub x.</span> <span m='1179000'>That
  is a part of a criterion that we already had when we had</span> <span m='1183000'>only
  two variables. But now, of course,</span> <span m='1186000'>we need to do the same
  thing when we look at x and z or y and</span> <span m='1190000'>z. That gives us
  two more</span> <span m='1193000'>conditions. P sub z is f sub xz,</span> <span
  m='1198000'>which is the same as f sub zx, so it should be the same as R</span>
  <span m='1210000'>sub x. Finally, Q sub z,</span> <span m='1214000'>which is f sub
  yz, equals f sub zy equals R sub y.</span> <span m='1222000'>We have three conditions,
  so our criterion -- Vector</span> <span m='1233000'>field F equals <P, Q, R>.</span>
  <span m='1241000'>And here, to be completely truthful, I have to say defined</span>
  <span m='1246000'>in a simply connected region. Otherwise, we might have the</span>
  <span m='1250000'>same kind of strange things happening as before.</span> <span
  m='1253000'>Let's not worry too much about it.</span> <span m='1263000'>For accuracy
  we need our vector field to be defined in a simply</span> <span m='1267000'>connected
  region. And example is just if it is</span> <span m='1270000'>defined everywhere.
  If you don't have any evil</span> <span m='1274000'>eliminators then you can just
  go ahead and there is no problem.</span> <span m='1281000'>It is a gradient field.
  We need three conditions.</span> <span m='1296000'>Let's do it in order. P sub y
  equals Q sub x.</span> <span m='1303000'>And we have P sub z equals R sub x and
  Q sub z equals R sub</span> <span m='1312000'>y. How do you remember these three</span>
  <span m='1315000'>conditions? Well, it is pretty easy.</span> <span m='1316000'>You
  pick any two components, say the x and the z component,</span> <span m='1321000'>and
  you take the partial of the x component with respect to z,</span> <span m='1324000'>the
  partial of the z component with respect to x and you must</span> <span m='1327000'>make
  them equal. And the same with every pair of</span> <span m='1332000'>variables.
  In fact, if you had a function</span> <span m='1335000'>of many more variables the
  criterion would still look</span> <span m='1337000'>exactly like that. For every
  pair of components</span> <span m='1341000'>the mixed partials must be the same.</span>
  <span m='1344000'>But we are not going to go beyond three variables so you</span>
  <span m='1347000'>don't need to know that. This you need to know so let me</span>
  <span m='1352000'>box it.</span> <span m='1371000'>That is pretty straightforward.
  Let's do an example just to see</span> <span m='1382000'>how it goes. By the way,
  we can also think</span> <span m='1391000'>of it in terms of differentials. Before
  I do the example,</span> <span m='1399000'>let me just say in a different language.</span>
  <span m='1402000'>If we have a differential given to us of a form Pdx Qdy Rdz is</span>
  <span m='1409000'>going to be an exact differential,</span> <span m='1413000'>which
  means it is equal to df for some function F exactly and</span> <span m='1420000'>of
  the same conditions. That is the same thing.</span> <span m='1423000'>Just in the
  language of differentials.</span> <span m='1431000'>The example that I promised.
  Of course, I could do again the</span> <span m='1437000'>same one over there and
  check that it satisfies the condition,</span> <span m='1440000'>but then it wouldn't
  be much fun.</span> <span m='1442000'>So let's do a better one. Actually, let's
  do it in a way</span> <span m='1450000'>that looks like an exam problem. Let's say
  for which a and b is</span> <span m='1458000'>a xy dx plus -- Oh, it is not going
  to fit here.</span> <span m='1469000'>But it will fit here. a xy dx ( x^2 z^3) dy
  (byz^2 -</span> <span m='1479000'>4z^3) dz, an exact differential. Or, if you don't
  like exact</span> <span m='1491000'>differentials, for which a and b is the</span>
  <span m='1494000'>corresponding vector field with i, j and k instead,</span> <span
  m='1498000'>a gradient field. Let's just apply the criterion.</span> <span m='1502000'>And,
  of course, you can guess that what will</span> <span m='1506000'>follow is figuring
  out how to find the potential when there is</span> <span m='1511000'>one.</span>
  <span m='1533000'>Let's do it one by one. We want to compare P sub y with</span>
  <span m='1540000'>Q sub x, we want to compare P sub z with</span> <span m='1545000'>R
  sub x and we want to compare Q sub z with R sub y where we call</span> <span m='1553000'>P,
  Q and R these guys. Let's see.</span> <span m='1557000'>What is P sub y? That seems
  to be ax.</span> <span m='1564000'>What is Q sub x? 2x.</span> <span m='1569000'>Q
  is this one. Actually, let me write them</span> <span m='1572000'>down. Because
  otherwise I am going to</span> <span m='1576000'>get confused myself. This guy here,</span>
  <span m='1581000'>that is P, this guy here, that is Q and that guy here,</span>
  <span m='1592000'>that is R. This one tells us that a should</span> <span m='1598000'>be
  equal to two of the first product that you hold.</span> <span m='1603000'>OK. Let's
  look at P sub z. That is just zero.</span> <span m='1609000'>R sub x? Well, R doesn't
  have any x</span> <span m='1611000'>either so that is zero. This one is not a problem.</span>
  <span m='1616000'>Q sub z? Well, that seems to be 3z2.</span> <span m='1622000'>R
  sub y seems to be bz2, so b should be equal to three.</span> <span m='1634000'>We
  need to have a equals two and, this is an and,</span> <span m='1639000'>not or,
  b equals three for this to be exact.</span> <span m='1643000'>For those values of
  a and b, we can look for a potential</span> <span m='1647000'>using the method that
  we are going to see right now.</span> <span m='1650000'>For any other values of
  a and b we cannot.</span> <span m='1653000'>If we have to compute a line integral,
  we have to do it by</span> <span m='1658000'>finding a parameter and setting up
  everything.</span> <span m='1662000'>Any questions at this point? Yes?</span> <span
  m='1677000'>I see. Well, if I got the same answer,</span> <span m='1680000'>oh,
  did say bz^2 or 3bz^2? Well, 3bz^2, for example,</span> <span m='1685000'>I would
  need b to be zero because the only time that 3bz2</span> <span m='1689000'>equals
  bz2 as not just at one point but everywhere,</span> <span m='1693000'>I need them
  to be the same function of x,</span> <span m='1695000'>y, z. Well, if a coefficient
  of z2 is</span> <span m='1698000'>the same that would be give b equals 3b, that
  would give me b</span> <span m='1702000'>equals zero. If you got bz2 on both sides</span>
  <span m='1705000'>then it would mean for any value of b it works,</span> <span m='1709000'>and
  you wouldn't have to worry about what the value of b is.</span> <span m='1715000'>Any
  other questions? No.</span> <span m='1721000'>OK. Now, how do we find the</span>
  <span m='1730000'>potential? Well, there are two methods as</span> <span m='1738000'>before.
  One of them,</span> <span m='1739000'>I don't remember if it was the first one or
  the second one last</span> <span m='1742000'>time, but it really doesn't matter.</span>
  <span m='1744000'>One of them was just to say that the value of F at the</span>
  <span m='1750000'>point, let me call that x1, y1, z1,</span> <span m='1755000'>is
  equal to the line integral of my field along a well-chosen</span> <span m='1762000'>curve
  plus, of course, a constant,</span> <span m='1765000'>which is going to be the integration
  constant.</span> <span m='1770000'>And the kind of curve that I will take to do
  this calculation</span> <span m='1779000'>will just be my favorite curve going from
  the origin to the</span> <span m='1788000'>point x1, y1, z1.</span> <span m='1791000'>And
  so, typically the most common choice would be to go</span> <span m='1797000'>just
  first along the x-axis, then parallel to the y-axis and</span> <span m='1804000'>then
  parallel to the z-axis all the way to my point x1,</span> <span m='1811000'>y1,
  z1. I would just calculate three</span> <span m='1814000'>easy line integrals. Add
  them together and that</span> <span m='1818000'>would give me the value of my function.</span>
  <span m='1821000'>That method works exactly the same way as it did in two</span>
  <span m='1827000'>variables. Now, I seem to recall that you</span> <span m='1830000'>guys
  mostly preferred the other method.</span> <span m='1832000'>I am going to tell you
  about the other method as well,</span> <span m='1834000'>but I just want to point
  out this one actually doesn't become</span> <span m='1837000'>more complicated.
  The other one has actually more</span> <span m='1840000'>steps. I mean, of course,</span>
  <span m='1842000'>here there are also a bit more steps because you have three</span>
  <span m='1845000'>parts to your path instead of two.</span> <span m='1847000'>You
  have three line integrals to compute instead of two,</span> <span m='1854000'>but
  conceptually it remains exactly the same idea.</span> <span m='1859000'>I should
  say it works the same way as in 2D.</span> <span m='1867000'>Not much changes. Let's
  look at the other method</span> <span m='1877000'>using anti-derivatives. Remember
  we want to find a</span> <span m='1884000'>function little f whose partials are
  exactly the things we have</span> <span m='1889000'>been given. We want to solve,</span>
  <span m='1891000'>well, let me plug in the values of a and b that will work.</span>
  <span m='1896000'>We said a should be two, so f sub x should be 2xy,</span> <span
  m='1907000'>f sub y should be x2 plus z3, and f sub z should be 3yz^2</span> <span
  m='1919000'>minus 4z^3. We are going to look at them</span> <span m='1924000'>one
  at a time and get partial information on the function.</span> <span m='1927000'>And
  then we will compare with the others to get more</span> <span m='1931000'>information
  until we are completely done.</span> <span m='1935000'>The first thing we will do,
  we know that f sub x is 2xy.</span> <span m='1945000'>That should tell us something
  about f.</span> <span m='1947000'>Well, let's just integrate that with respect to
  x.</span> <span m='1951000'>Let me write integral dx next to that.</span> <span
  m='1956000'>That tells us that f should be, well, if we integrate that with</span>
  <span m='1961000'>respect to x, 2x integrates to x^2,</span> <span m='1964000'>so
  we should get x2y. Plus, of course,</span> <span m='1967000'>an integration constant.
  Now, what do we mean by</span> <span m='1970000'>integration constant. It means
  that for given values</span> <span m='1973000'>of y and z we will get a term that
  does not depend on x.</span> <span m='1978000'>It still depends on y and z. In fact,
  what we get is a</span> <span m='1982000'>function of y and z. See, if you took
  the derivative</span> <span m='1987000'>of this with respect to x you will get 2xy
  and this guy will</span> <span m='1992000'>go away because there is no x in it.</span>
  <span m='1996000'>That is the first step. Now we need to get some</span> <span m='1999000'>information
  on g. How do we do that?</span> <span m='2001000'>Well, we look at the other partials.</span>
  <span m='2008000'>F sub y, we want that to be x^2 z^3.</span> <span m='2015000'>But
  we have another way to find it, which is starting from this</span> <span m='2021000'>and
  differentiating. Let me try to use color for</span> <span m='2030000'>this. Now,
  if I take the partial of</span> <span m='2034000'>this with respect to y, I am going
  to get a different</span> <span m='2038000'>formula for f sub y. That will be x^2
  plus g sub y.</span> <span m='2046000'>Well, if I compare these two expressions
  that tells me that g</span> <span m='2055000'>sub y should be z3. Now, if I have
  this I can</span> <span m='2063000'>integrate with respect to y. That will tell
  me that g is</span> <span m='2072000'>actually yz^3 plus an integration constant.</span>
  <span m='2079000'>That constant, again, does not depend on y,</span> <span m='2082000'>but
  it can still depend on z because we still have not said</span> <span m='2086000'>anything
  about partial with respect to z.</span> <span m='2089000'>In fact, that constant
  I will write as a function h of z.</span> <span m='2094000'>If I have this function
  of z and I take its partial with</span> <span m='2100000'>respect to y, I will still
  get z^3 no matter</span> <span m='2104000'>what h was. Now, how do I find h?</span>
  <span m='2106000'>Well, obviously, I have to look at f sub z.</span> <span m='2141000'>F
  sub z. We know from the given vector</span> <span m='2147000'>field that we want
  it to be 3yz^2 minus 4z^3.</span> <span m='2153000'>In case you are wondering where
  that came from,</span> <span m='2156000'>that was R. But that is also obtained by</span>
  <span m='2161000'>differentiating with respect to z what we had so far.</span> <span
  m='2169000'>Sorry. What did we have so far?</span> <span m='2175000'>Well, we had
  f equals x^2y plus g.</span> <span m='2180000'>And we said g is actually yz^3 plus
  h of z.</span> <span m='2190000'>That is what we have so far. If we take the derivative
  of</span> <span m='2197000'>that with respect to z, we will get zero plus 3yz^2</span>
  <span m='2204000'>plus h prime of z, or dh dz as you want.</span> <span m='2211000'>Now,
  if we compare these two, we will get the derivative of</span> <span m='2219000'>h.
  It will tell us that h prime is</span> <span m='2223000'>negative for z3. That means
  that h is negative</span> <span m='2228000'>z^4 plus a constant. And this it is
  at last an</span> <span m='2233000'>actual constant. Because it does not depend
  on z</span> <span m='2237000'>and there is nothing else for it to depend on.</span>
  <span m='2241000'>Now we plug this into what we had before, and that will give</span>
  <span m='2253000'>us our function f. We get that f=x^2y yz^3 - z^4</span> <span
  m='2264000'>plus constant. If you just wanted to find one</span> <span m='2269000'>potential,
  you can just forget the constant.</span> <span m='2271000'>This guy was a potential.
  If you want all the potentials</span> <span m='2275000'>they differ by this constant.
  OK.</span> <span m='2278000'>Just to recap the method what did we do?</span> <span
  m='2281000'>We started with -- And, of course, you can do it in</span> <span m='2284000'>whichever
  order you prefer, but you have to still follow</span> <span m='2287000'>the systematic
  method. You start with f sub x and you</span> <span m='2291000'>integrate that with
  respect to x.</span> <span m='2293000'>That gives you f up to a function of y and
  z only.</span> <span m='2299000'>Now you compare f sub y as given to you by the
  vector field</span> <span m='2305000'>with the formula you get from this expression
  for f.</span> <span m='2312000'>And, of course, this one will involve g sub y.</span>
  <span m='2316000'>Out of this, you will get the value of g sub</span> <span m='2321000'>y.
  When you have g sub y that</span> <span m='2324000'>gives you g up to a function
  of z only.</span> <span m='2328000'>And so now you have f up to a function of z
  only.</span> <span m='2332000'>And what you will do is look at the derivative with
  respect to</span> <span m='2337000'>z, the one you want coming from</span> <span
  m='2339000'>the vector field and the one you have coming from this formula</span>
  <span m='2342000'>for f, match them and that will tell</span> <span m='2345000'>you
  h prime. You will get h and then you</span> <span m='2349000'>will get f. Any questions?</span>
  <span m='2360000'>Who still prefers this method? OK, still most of you.</span> <span
  m='2365000'>Who is thinking that maybe the other method was not so bad</span> <span
  m='2369000'>after all? OK. That is still a minority.</span> <span m='2373000'>You
  can choose whichever one you prefer.</span> <span m='2376000'>I would encourage
  you to get some practice by trying both on</span> <span m='2382000'>least a couple
  of examples just to make sure that you know how</span> <span m='2387000'>to do them
  both and then stick to whichever one you prefer.</span> <span m='2393000'>Any questions
  on that? No. I guess I already asked.</span> <span m='2399000'>Still no questions?
  OK.</span> <span m='2407000'>The next logical thing is going to be curl.</span>
  <span m='2413000'>And the theorem that is going to replace Green's theorem for</span>
  <span m='2417000'>work in this setting is going to be called Stokes' theorem.</span>
  <span m='2421000'>Let me start by telling you about curl in 3D.</span> <span m='2434000'>Here
  is the statement. The curl is just going to</span> <span m='2439000'>measure how
  much your vector field fails to be conservative.</span> <span m='2443000'>And, if
  you want to think about it in terms of motions,</span> <span m='2447000'>that also
  will measure the rotation part of the motion.</span> <span m='2451000'>Well, let
  me first give a definition.</span> <span m='2455000'>Let's say that my vector field
  has components P,</span> <span m='2460000'>Q and R. Then we define the curl of F
  to</span> <span m='2466000'>be R sub y minus Q sub z times i plus P sub z minus
  R sub x times</span> <span m='2476000'>j plus Q sub x minus P sub y times k.</span>
  <span m='2481000'>And of course nobody can remember this formula,</span> <span m='2485000'>so
  what is the structure of this formula?</span> <span m='2488000'>Well, you see, each
  of these guys is one of</span> <span m='2495000'>the things that have to be zero
  for our field to be</span> <span m='2503000'>conservative. If F is defined in a
  simply</span> <span m='2512000'>connected region then we have that F is conservative
  and is</span> <span m='2525000'>equivalent to if and only if curl F is zero.</span>
  <span m='2535000'>Now, an important difference between curl here and curl in</span>
  <span m='2539000'>the plane is that now the curl of a vector field is again a</span>
  <span m='2543000'>vector field. These expressions are functions</span> <span m='2547000'>of
  x, y, z and together you form a vector out of them.</span> <span m='2551000'>The
  curl of a vector field in space is actually a vector</span> <span m='2556000'>field,
  not a scalar function. I have delayed the inevitable.</span> <span m='2563000'>I
  have to really tell you how to remember this evil formula.</span> <span m='2567000'>The
  secret is that, in fact, you can think of this</span> <span m='2575000'>as del cross
  f. Maybe you have seen that in</span> <span m='2581000'>physics. This is really
  where this del</span> <span m='2584000'>notation becomes extremely useful, because
  that is</span> <span m='2588000'>basically the only way to remember the formula
  for curl.</span> <span m='2610000'>Remember we introduced the dell operator.</span>
  <span m='2614000'>That was this symbolic vector operator in which the components</span>
  <span m='2622000'>are the partial derivative operators.</span> <span m='2627000'>We
  have seen that if you apply this to a scalar function then</span> <span m='2639000'>that
  will give you the gradient. And we have seen that if you do</span> <span m='2648000'>the
  dot product between dell and a vector field,</span> <span m='2653000'>maybe I should
  give it components P,</span> <span m='2659000'>Q and R, you will get partial P over</span>
  <span m='2664000'>partial x plus partial Q over partial y plus partial R over</span>
  <span m='2670000'>partial z, which is the divergence.</span> <span m='2676000'>And
  so now what is new is that if I try to do dell cross F,</span> <span m='2687000'>well,
  what is dell cross F? I have to set up a</span> <span m='2693000'>cross-product
  between this strange thing that is not really</span> <span m='2698000'>a vector.
  I mean, I cannot really think</span> <span m='2702000'>of partial over partial x
  as a number.</span> <span m='2705000'>And my vector field <P, Q, R>.</span> <span
  m='2710000'>See, that is really a completely perverted use of a</span> <span m='2714000'>determinant
  notation. Initially, determinants were</span> <span m='2718000'>just supposed to
  be you had a three by three table of numbers</span> <span m='2721000'>and you computed
  a number out of them.</span> <span m='2723000'>These guys are functions so they
  count as numbers,</span> <span m='2728000'>but these are vectors and these are partial
  derivatives.</span> <span m='2733000'>It doesn't really make much sense, except
  this notation.</span> <span m='2737000'>If you try to enter this into a calculator
  or computer,</span> <span m='2743000'>it will just yell back at you saying are you
  crazy.</span> <span m='2748000'>[LAUGHTER] We just use that as a notation</span>
  <span m='2750000'>to remember what is in there. Let's try and see how that</span>
  <span m='2753000'>works. The component of i in this</span> <span m='2755000'>cross-product,
  remember that is this smaller</span> <span m='2758000'>determinant, that smaller
  determinant is</span> <span m='2761000'>partial over partial y of R minus partial
  over partial z of</span> <span m='2767000'>Q, the coefficient of i.</span> <span
  m='2770000'>And that seems to be what I had over there.</span> <span m='2774000'>If
  not then I made a mistake. Minus the next determinant</span> <span m='2778000'>times
  z. Remember there is always a</span> <span m='2780000'>minus sign in front of a
  j component when you do a</span> <span m='2783000'>cross-product. The other one
  is partial over</span> <span m='2787000'>partial x R minus partial over partial
  z of P plus the</span> <span m='2793000'>component of z which is going to be partial
  over partial x Q</span> <span m='2799000'>minus partial over partial y P. And that
  is indeed going to be</span> <span m='2806000'>the curl of F. In practice,</span>
  <span m='2808000'>if you have to compute the curl of a vector field,</span> <span
  m='2811000'>you know, don't try to remember this formula.</span> <span m='2813000'>Just
  set up this cross-product with whatever formulas you have</span> <span m='2819000'>for
  the components of a field and then compute it.</span> <span m='2824000'>Don't bother
  to try to remember the general formula,</span> <span m='2835000'>just remember this.
  What is the geometric</span> <span m='2845000'>interpretation of curl, just to finish?</span>
  <span m='2855000'>In a way, I will say just curl measures the rotation component</span>
  <span m='2868000'>in a velocity field. An exercise that you can do,</span> <span
  m='2875000'>which is actually pretty easy to check, is say that we have a</span>
  <span m='2879000'>fluid that is just rotating about the x-axis uniformly.</span>
  <span m='2884000'>Your fluid is just rotating like that about the z-axis.</span>
  <span m='2890000'>If I take a rotation about the z-axis.</span> <span m='2895000'>That
  is given by a velocity field with components at angular</span> <span m='2908000'>velocity
  omega. That will be negative omega</span> <span m='2915000'>times y, then omega
  x and zero. And the curl of that you can</span> <span m='2921000'>compute, and you
  will find two omega times k.</span> <span m='2925000'>Concretely, this curl gives
  you the angular</span> <span m='2928000'>velocity of the rotation, well, with a
  factor two but</span> <span m='2931000'>that doesn't matter, and the axis of rotation,</span>
  <span m='2933000'>the direction of the axis of rotation.</span> <span m='2936000'>It
  tells you it is rotating about a vertical axis.</span> <span m='2939000'>And, in
  general, if you have a complicated</span> <span m='2941000'>motion some of it might
  be, you know, there is a</span> <span m='2943000'>translation. And then within that</span>
  <span m='2945000'>translation there is maybe expansion and rotation and</span> <span
  m='2948000'>sharing and everything. And the curl will compute how</span> <span m='2951000'>much
  rotation is taking place. It will tell you,</span> <span m='2954000'>say that you
  have a very small solid,</span> <span m='2956000'>I don't know like a ping pong
  ball in your flow,</span> <span m='2959000'>and it is just going with the flow,</span>
  <span m='2961000'>it tells you how it is going to start rotating.</span> <span m='2965000'>That
  is what curl measures. On Thursday we will see Stokes'</span> <span m='2972000'>theorem,
  which will be the last ingredient before the next exam.</span> <span m='2977000'>And
  then on Friday we will review stuff.</span> </p>
