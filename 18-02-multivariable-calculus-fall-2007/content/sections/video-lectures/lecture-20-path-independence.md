  \ at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='23000'>So, let me remind you, yesterday we've\
  \ defined and</span> <span m='28000'>started to compute line integrals for work\
  \ as a vector</span> <span m='34000'>field along a curve. So, we have a curve in\
  \ the</span> <span m='41000'>plane, C. We have a vector field that</span> <span\
  \ m='48000'>gives us a vector at every point.</span> <span m='55000'>And, we want\
  \ to find the work done along the curve.</span> <span m='64000'>So, that's the line\
  \ integral along C of F dr,</span> <span m='71000'>or more geometrically, line integral\
  \ along C of F.T ds</span> <span m='76000'>where T is the unit tangent vector,</span>\
  \ <span m='79000'>and ds is the arc length element.</span> <span m='83000'>Or, in\
  \ coordinates, that they integral of M dx N dy</span> <span m='90000'>where M and\
  \ N are the components of the vector field.</span> <span m='98000'>OK, so -- Let's\
  \ do an example that will just summarize what we</span> <span m='106000'>did yesterday,\
  \ and then we will move on to</span> <span m='111000'>interesting observations about\
  \ these things.</span> <span m='117000'>So, here's an example we are going to look\
  \ at now.</span> <span m='123000'>Let's say I give you the vector field yi plus\
  \ xj.</span> <span m='131000'>So, it's not completely obvious what it looks like,</span>\
  \ <span m='133000'>but here is a computer plot of that vector field.</span> <span\
  \ m='136000'>So, that tells you a bit what it does.</span> <span m='141000'>It points\
  \ in all sorts of directions.</span> <span m='144000'>And, let's say we want to\
  \ find the work done by this vector</span> <span m='151000'>field. If I move along\
  \ this closed</span> <span m='155000'>curve, I start at the origin. But, I moved\
  \ along the x-axis</span> <span m='160000'>to one. That move along the unit circle</span>\
  \ <span m='163000'>to the diagonal, and then I move back to the</span> <span m='166000'>origin\
  \ in a straight line. OK, so C consists of three</span> <span m='174000'>parts --\
  \ -- so that you enclose a sector of a unit disk -- --</span> <span m='186000'>corresponding\
  \ to angles between zero and 45\uFFFD.</span> <span m='197000'>So, to compute this\
  \ line integral, all we have to do is</span> <span m='204000'>we have set up three\
  \ different integrals and add that together.</span> <span m='213000'>OK, so we need\
  \ to set up the integral of y dx plus x dy for</span> <span m='224000'>each of these\
  \ pieces. So, let's do the first one on</span> <span m='234000'>the x-axis. Well,\
  \ one way to parameterize</span> <span m='239000'>that is just use the x variable.\
  \ And, say that because we are on</span> <span m='246000'>the, let's see, sorry,\
  \ we are going from the</span> <span m='252000'>origin to (1,0). Well, we know we\
  \ are on the</span> <span m='257000'>x-axis. So, y there is actually just</span>\
  \ <span m='262000'>zero. And, the variable will be x</span> <span m='265000'>from\
  \ zero to one. Or, if you prefer,</span> <span m='268000'>you can parameterize things,\
  \ say, x equals t for t from zero</span> <span m='271000'>to one, and y equals zero.\
  \ What doesn't change is y is</span> <span m='276000'>zero, and therefore, dy is\
  \ also zero.</span> <span m='281000'>So, in fact, we are integrating y dx x dy,</span>\
  \ <span m='288000'>but that becomes, well, zero dx 0,</span> <span m='293000'>and\
  \ that's just going to give you zero.</span> <span m='299000'>OK, so there's the\
  \ line integral.</span> <span m='303000'>Here, it's very easy to compute. Of course,\
  \ you can also do it</span> <span m='307000'>geometrically because geometrically,</span>\
  \ <span m='310000'>you can see in the picture along the x-axis,</span> <span m='312000'>the\
  \ vector field is pointing vertically.</span> <span m='315000'>If I'm on the x-axis,\
  \ my vector field is actually in</span> <span m='319000'>the y direction. So, it's\
  \ perpendicular to my</span> <span m='323000'>curve. So, the work done is going\
  \ to</span> <span m='324000'>be zero. F dot T will be zero.</span> <span m='348000'>OK,\
  \ so F dot T is zero, so the integral is zero.</span> <span m='351000'>OK, any questions\
  \ about this first part of the calculation?</span> <span m='357000'>No? It's OK?\
  \ OK, let's move on to more</span> <span m='364000'>interesting part of it. Let's\
  \ do the second part,</span> <span m='371000'>which is a portion of the unit circle.</span>\
  \ <span m='378000'>OK, so I should have drawn my picture.</span> <span m='384000'>And\
  \ so now we are moving on this part of the curve that's</span> <span m='397000'>C2.\
  \ And, of course we have to</span> <span m='400000'>choose how to express x and\
  \ y in terms of a single variable.</span> <span m='403000'>Well, most likely, when\
  \ you are moving on a</span> <span m='406000'>circle, you are going to use the angle\
  \ along the circle to tell</span> <span m='409000'>you where you are. OK, so we're\
  \ going to use the</span> <span m='413000'>angle theta as a parameter. And we will\
  \ say,</span> <span m='416000'>we are on the unit circle. So, x is cosine theta\
  \ and y is</span> <span m='422000'>sine theta. What's the range of theta?</span>\
  \ <span m='425000'>Theta goes from zero to pi over four, OK?</span> <span m='431000'>So,\
  \ whenever I see dx, I will replace it by,</span> <span m='435000'>well, the derivative\
  \ of cosine is negative sine.</span> <span m='439000'>So, minus sine theta d theta,\
  \ and dy, the derivative of sine</span> <span m='444000'>is cosine. So, it will\
  \ become cosine theta</span> <span m='449000'>d theta. OK, so I'm computing the</span>\
  \ <span m='454000'>integral of y dx x dy. That means -- -- I'll be</span> <span\
  \ m='461000'>actually computing the integral of, so, y is sine theta.</span> <span\
  \ m='472000'>dx, that's negative sine theta d theta plus x cosine.</span> <span\
  \ m='481000'>dy is cosine theta d theta from zero to pi/4.</span> <span m='488000'>OK,\
  \ so that's integral from zero to pi / 4 of cosine squared</span> <span m='497000'>minus\
  \ sine squared. And, if you know your trig,</span> <span m='502000'>then you should\
  \ recognize this as cosine of two theta.</span> <span m='507000'>OK, so that will\
  \ integrate to one half of sine two theta from</span> <span m='513000'>zero to pi\
  \ over four, sorry.</span> <span m='516000'>And, sine pi over two is one. So, you\
  \ will get one half.</span> <span m='524000'>OK, any questions about this one?</span>\
  \ <span m='529000'>No? OK, then let's do the third one.</span> <span m='547000'>So,\
  \ the third guy is when we come back to the origin along</span> <span m='555000'>the\
  \ diagonal. OK, so we go in a straight line</span> <span m='558000'>from this point.\
  \ Where's this point?</span> <span m='560000'>Well, this point is one over root\
  \ two, one over root two.</span> <span m='565000'>And, we go back to the origin.\
  \ OK, so we need to figure out a</span> <span m='572000'>way to express x and y\
  \ in terms of the same parameter.</span> <span m='578000'>So, one way which is very\
  \ natural would be to just say,</span> <span m='583000'>well, let's say we move\
  \ from here to here over time.</span> <span m='587000'>And, at time zero, we are\
  \ here. At time one, we are here.</span> <span m='590000'>We know how to parameterize\
  \ this line.</span> <span m='594000'>So, what we could do is say, let's parameterize\
  \ this line.</span> <span m='602000'>So, we start at one over root two, and we go\
  \ down by one over</span> <span m='609000'>root two in time one. And, same with\
  \ y.</span> <span m='619000'>That's actually perfectly fine. But that's unnecessarily</span>\
  \ <span m='624000'>complicated. OK, why is a complicated?</span> <span m='627000'>Because\
  \ we will get all of these expressions.</span> <span m='630000'>It would be easier\
  \ to actually just look at motion in this</span> <span m='634000'>direction and\
  \ then say, well, if we have a certain work</span> <span m='638000'>if we move from\
  \ here to here, then the work done moving from</span> <span m='642000'>here to here\
  \ is just going to be the opposite,</span> <span m='646000'>OK? So, in fact,</span>\
  \ <span m='648000'>we can do slightly better by just saying, well,</span> <span\
  \ m='655000'>we'll take x = t, y = t.</span> <span m='659000'>t from zero to one\
  \ over root two, and take,</span> <span m='667000'>well, sorry, that gives us what\
  \ I will call</span> <span m='675000'>minus C3, which is C3 backwards. And then\
  \ we can say the</span> <span m='685000'>integral for work along minus C3 is the\
  \ opposite of the work</span> <span m='691000'>along C3. Or, if you're comfortable\
  \ with</span> <span m='695000'>integration where variables go down,</span> <span\
  \ m='699000'>then you could also say that t just goes from one over square</span>\
  \ <span m='702000'>root of two down to zero. And, when you set up your</span> <span\
  \ m='705000'>integral, it will go from one over root two to zero.</span> <span m='709000'>And,\
  \ of course, that will be the negative of</span> <span m='710000'>the one from zero\
  \ to one over root two.</span> <span m='712000'>So, it's the same thing. OK, so\
  \ if we do it with this</span> <span m='719000'>parameterization, we'll get that,</span>\
  \ <span m='723000'>well of course, dx is dt, dy is dt.</span> <span m='728000'>So,\
  \ the integral along minus C3 of y dx plus x dy is just the</span> <span m='736000'>integral\
  \ from zero to one over root two of t dt plus t dt.</span> <span m='744000'>Sorry,\
  \ I'm messing up my blackboard, OK,</span> <span m='750000'>which is going to be,\
  \ well, the integral of 2t dt,</span> <span m='757000'>which is t2 between these\
  \ bounds, which is one half.</span> <span m='766000'>That's the integral along minus\
  \ C3, along the reversed path.</span> <span m='771000'>And, if I want to do it along\
  \ C3 instead, then I just take the</span> <span m='783000'>negative. Or, if you\
  \ prefer,</span> <span m='787000'>you could have done it directly with integral\
  \ from one over root</span> <span m='791000'>two, two zero, which gives you immediately\
  \ the</span> <span m='794000'>negative one half. OK, so at the end,</span> <span\
  \ m='799000'>we get that the total work -- -- was the sum of the three line</span>\
  \ <span m='808000'>integrals. I'm not writing after dr just</span> <span m='812000'>to\
  \ save space. But, zero plus one half minus</span> <span m='816000'>one half, and\
  \ that comes out to zero.</span> <span m='819000'>So, a lot of calculations for\
  \ nothing.</span> <span m='824000'>OK, so that should give you overview of various\
  \ ways to</span> <span m='829000'>compute line integrals. Any questions about all\
  \ that?</span> <span m='837000'>No? OK. So, next, let me tell you about</span> <span\
  \ m='843000'>how to avoid computing like integrals.</span> <span m='847000'>Well,\
  \ one is easy: don't take this class.</span> <span m='848000'>But that's not, so\
  \ here's another way not to do</span> <span m='857000'>it, OK? So, let's look a\
  \ little bit</span> <span m='860000'>about one kind of vector field that actually\
  \ we've encountered</span> <span m='864000'>a few weeks ago without saying it.</span>\
  \ <span m='866000'>So, we said when we have a function of two variables,</span>\
  \ <span m='870000'>we have the gradient vector. Well, at the time,</span> <span\
  \ m='872000'>it was just a vector. But, that vector depended on x</span> <span m='875000'>and\
  \ y. So, in fact,</span> <span m='876000'>it's a vector field. OK, so here's an\
  \ interesting</span> <span m='883000'>special case. Say that F, our vector field\
  \ is</span> <span m='888000'>actually the gradient of some function.</span> <span\
  \ m='892000'>So, it's a gradient field. And, so f is a function of two</span> <span\
  \ m='901000'>variables, x and y, and that's called the potential</span> <span m='908000'>for\
  \ the vector field. The reason is,</span> <span m='912000'>of course, from physics.\
  \ In physics, you call potential,</span> <span m='916000'>electrical potential or\
  \ gravitational potential,</span> <span m='921000'>the potential energy. This function\
  \ of position that</span> <span m='925000'>tells you how much actually energy stored\
  \ somehow by the</span> <span m='929000'>force field, and this gradient gives you\
  \ the force.</span> <span m='933000'>Actually, not quite. If you are a physicist,</span>\
  \ <span m='937000'>that the force will be negative the gradient.</span> <span m='940000'>So,\
  \ that means that physicists' potentials are the opposite of a</span> <span m='944000'>mathematician's\
  \ potential. Okay?</span> <span m='946000'>So it's just here to confuse you.</span>\
  \ <span m='948000'>It doesn't really matter all the time.</span> <span m='950000'>So\
  \ to make things simpler we are using this convention and</span> <span m='955000'>you\
  \ just put a minus sign if you are doing physics.</span> <span m='959000'>So then\
  \ I claim that we can simplify the evaluation of the</span> <span m='973000'>line\
  \ integral for work. Perhaps you've seen in physics,</span> <span m='981000'>the\
  \ work done by, say, the electrical force,</span> <span m='984000'>is actually given\
  \ by the change in the value of a potential from</span> <span m='988000'>the starting\
  \ point of the ending point,</span> <span m='990000'>or same for gravitational force.\
  \ So, these are special cases of</span> <span m='996000'>what's called the fundamental\
  \ theorem of calculus for line</span> <span m='1000000'>integrals. So, the fundamental\
  \ theorem of</span> <span m='1003000'>calculus, not for line integrals, tells you\
  \ if you</span> <span m='1006000'>integrate a derivative, then you get back the\
  \ function.</span> <span m='1009000'>And here, it's the same thing in multivariable\
  \ calculus.</span> <span m='1012000'>It tells you, if you take the line integral</span>\
  \ <span m='1014000'>of the gradient of a function, what you get back is the</span>\
  \ <span m='1018000'>function.</span> <span m='1043000'>OK, so -- -- the fundamental</span>\
  \ <span m='1050000'>theorem of calculus for line integrals -- -- says if you</span>\
  \ <span m='1063000'>integrate a vector field that's the gradient of a function along</span>\
  \ <span m='1078000'>a curve, let's say that you have a curve</span> <span m='1083000'>that\
  \ goes from some starting point, P0,</span> <span m='1086000'>to some ending point,\
  \ P1. All you will get is the value</span> <span m='1095000'>of F at P1 minus the\
  \ value of F at P0.</span> <span m='1101000'>OK, so, that's a pretty nifty formula\
  \ that only works if the</span> <span m='1105000'>field that you are integrating\
  \ is a gradient.</span> <span m='1108000'>You know it's a gradient, and you know\
  \ the function,</span> <span m='1112000'>little f. I mean, we can't put just any</span>\
  \ <span m='1115000'>vector field in here. We have to put the gradient of</span>\
  \ <span m='1118000'>F. So, actually on Tuesday we'll</span> <span m='1121000'>see\
  \ how to decide whether a vector field is a gradient or</span> <span m='1127000'>not,\
  \ and if it is a gradient,</span> <span m='1129000'>how to find the potential function.</span>\
  \ <span m='1132000'>So, we'll cover that. But, for now we need to try to</span>\
  \ <span m='1138000'>figure out a bit more about this, what it says,</span> <span\
  \ m='1145000'>what it means physically, how to think of it</span> <span m='1151000'>geometrically,\
  \ and so on.</span> <span m='1155000'>So, maybe I should say, if you're trying to\
  \ write this</span> <span m='1158000'>in coordinates, because that's also a useful</span>\
  \ <span m='1161000'>way to think about it, if I give you the line integral</span>\
  \ <span m='1164000'>along C, so, the gradient field,</span> <span m='1167000'>the\
  \ components are f sub x and f sub y.</span> <span m='1169000'>So, it means I'm\
  \ actually integrating f sub x dx plus f</span> <span m='1176000'>sub y dy. Or,\
  \ if you prefer,</span> <span m='1178000'>that's the same thing as actually integrating\
  \ df.</span> <span m='1182000'>So, I'm integrating the differential of a function,</span>\
  \ <span m='1186000'>f. Well then, that's the change in</span> <span m='1194000'>F.\
  \ And, of course,</span> <span m='1196000'>if you write it in this form, then probably\
  \ it's quite</span> <span m='1202000'>obvious to you that this should be true.</span>\
  \ <span m='1206000'>I mean, in this form, actually it's the same</span> <span m='1211000'>statement\
  \ as in single variable calculus.</span> <span m='1215000'>OK, and actually that's\
  \ how we prove the theorem.</span> <span m='1217000'>So, let's prove this theorem.\
  \ How do we prove it?</span> <span m='1227000'>Well, let's say I give you a curve\
  \ and I ask you to compute</span> <span m='1231000'>this integral. How will you\
  \ do that?</span> <span m='1234000'>Well, the way you compute the integral actually\
  \ is by choosing</span> <span m='1238000'>a parameter, and expressing everything\
  \ in terms of that</span> <span m='1241000'>parameter. So, we'll set,</span> <span\
  \ m='1246000'>well, so we know it's f sub x dx plus f sub y dy.</span> <span m='1257000'>And,\
  \ we'll want to parameterize C in the form x equals x of t.</span> <span m='1263000'>y\
  \ equals y of t. So, if we do that,</span> <span m='1269000'>then dx becomes x prime\
  \ of t dt.</span> <span m='1272000'>dy becomes y prime of t dt. So, we know x is\
  \ x of t.</span> <span m='1285000'>That tells us dx is x prime of t dt.</span> <span\
  \ m='1291000'>y is y of t gives us dy is y prime of t dt.</span> <span m='1298000'>So,\
  \ now what we are integrating actually becomes the integral of</span> <span m='1312000'>f\
  \ sub x times dx dt plus f sub y times dy dt times dt.</span> <span m='1325000'>OK,\
  \ but now, here I recognize a familiar</span> <span m='1329000'>guy. I've seen this\
  \ one before in</span> <span m='1333000'>the chain rule. OK, this guy,</span> <span\
  \ m='1335000'>by the chain rule, is the rate of change of f if I</span> <span m='1339000'>take\
  \ x and y to be functions of t.</span> <span m='1342000'>And, I plug those into\
  \ f. So, in fact,</span> <span m='1346000'>what I'm integrating is df dt when I\
  \ think of f as a function</span> <span m='1354000'>of t by just plugging x and\
  \ y as functions of t.</span> <span m='1362000'>And so maybe actually I should now\
  \ say I have sometimes t goes</span> <span m='1371000'>from some initial time, let's\
  \ say, t zero to t one.</span> <span m='1379000'>And now, by the usual fundamental\
  \ theorem of calculus,</span> <span m='1383000'>I know that this will be just the\
  \ change in the value of f</span> <span m='1387000'>between t zero and t one.</span>\
  \ <span m='1416000'>OK, so integral from t zero to one of (df /dt) dt,</span> <span\
  \ m='1424000'>well, that becomes f between t zero and t one.</span> <span m='1432000'>f\
  \ of what? We just have to be a little bit</span> <span m='1435000'>careful here.\
  \ Well, it's not quite f of t.</span> <span m='1438000'>It's f seen as a function\
  \ of t by putting x of t and y of t</span> <span m='1442000'>into it. So, let me\
  \ read that carefully.</span> <span m='1447000'>What I'm integrating to is f of\
  \ x of t and y of t.</span> <span m='1455000'>Does that sound fair? Yeah, and so,</span>\
  \ <span m='1459000'>when I plug in t1, I get the point where I am at</span> <span\
  \ m='1463000'>time t1. That's the endpoint of my curve.</span> <span m='1466000'>When\
  \ I plug t0, I will get the starting point</span> <span m='1471000'>of my curve,\
  \ p0. And, that's the end of the</span> <span m='1477000'>proof. It wasn't that\
  \ hard, see?</span> <span m='1483000'>OK, so let's see an example. Well, let's look\
  \ at that</span> <span m='1496000'>example again. So, we have this curve.</span>\
  \ <span m='1500000'>We have this vector field. Could it be that,</span> <span m='1503000'>by\
  \ accident, that vector field was a</span> <span m='1505000'>gradient field? So,\
  \ remember,</span> <span m='1508000'>our vector field was y, x.</span> <span m='1512000'>Can\
  \ we think of a function whose derivative with respect to</span> <span m='1516000'>x\
  \ is y, and derivative with respect to y is x?</span> <span m='1519000'>Yeah, x\
  \ times y sounds like a good candidate where f( x,</span> <span m='1527000'>y) is\
  \ xy. OK,</span> <span m='1530000'>so that means that the line integrals that we\
  \ computed along</span> <span m='1534000'>these things can be just evaluated from\
  \ just finding out</span> <span m='1539000'>the values of f at the endpoint? So,\
  \ here's version two of my</span> <span m='1544000'>plot where I've added the contour\
  \ plot of a function,</span> <span m='1550000'>x, y on top of the vector field.</span>\
  \ <span m='1553000'>Actually, they have a vector field is still pointing</span>\
  \ <span m='1557000'>perpendicular to the level curves that we have seen,</span>\
  \ <span m='1560000'>just to remind you. And, so now,</span> <span m='1562000'>when\
  \ we move, now when we move,</span> <span m='1565000'>the origin is on the level\
  \ curve, f equals zero.</span> <span m='1569000'>And, when we start going along\
  \ C1, we stay on f equals zero.</span> <span m='1574000'>So, there's no work. The\
  \ potential doesn't change.</span> <span m='1577000'>Then on C2, the potential increases\
  \ from zero to one half.</span> <span m='1581000'>The work is one half. And then,\
  \ on C3,</span> <span m='1584000'>we go back down from one half to zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='1587000'>The work is negative one half. See, that was much easier than</span>\
  \ <span m='1600000'>computing. So, for example,</span> <span m='1607000'>the integral\
  \ along C2 is actually just,</span> <span m='1613000'>so, C2 goes from one zero\
  \ to one over root two,</span> <span m='1620000'>one over root two. So, that's one\
  \ half minus zero,</span> <span m='1629000'>and that's one half, OK, because C2\
  \ was going here.</span> <span m='1638000'>And, at this point, f is zero. At that\
  \ point, f is one half.</span> <span m='1646000'>And, similarly for the others,\
  \ and of course when you sum,</span> <span m='1649000'>you get zero because the\
  \ total change in f when you go from</span> <span m='1653000'>here, to here, to\
  \ here, to here,</span> <span m='1655000'>eventually you are back at the same place.</span>\
  \ <span m='1657000'>So, f hasn't changed. OK, so that's a neat trick.</span> <span\
  \ m='1664000'>And it's important conceptually because a lot of the forces are</span>\
  \ <span m='1668000'>gradients of potentials, namely, gravitational force,</span>\
  \ <span m='1673000'>electric force. The problem is not every vector</span> <span\
  \ m='1677000'>field is a gradient. A lot of vector fields are not</span> <span m='1680000'>gradients.\
  \ For example,</span> <span m='1682000'>magnetic fields certainly are not gradients.</span>\
  \ <span m='1688000'>So -- -- a big warning: everything today only applies</span>\
  \ <span m='1713000'>if F is a gradient field. OK, it's not true otherwise.</span>\
  \ <span m='1747000'>OK, still, let's see, what are the consequences of</span> <span\
  \ m='1759000'>the fundamental theorem? So, just to put one more time</span> <span\
  \ m='1770000'>this disclaimer, if F is a gradient field -- --</span> <span m='1779000'>then\
  \ what do we have? Well, there's various nice</span> <span m='1784000'>features\
  \ of work done by gradient fields that are not too</span> <span m='1787000'>far\
  \ off the vector fields. So, one of them is this</span> <span m='1793000'>property\
  \ of path independence. OK, so the claim is if I have a</span> <span m='1802000'>line\
  \ integral to compute, that it doesn't matter which</span> <span m='1805000'>path\
  \ I take as long as it goes from point a to point b.</span> <span m='1809000'>It\
  \ just depends on the point where I start and the point</span> <span m='1814000'>where\
  \ I end. And, that's certainly false in</span> <span m='1818000'>general, but for\
  \ a gradient field that works.</span> <span m='1822000'>So if I have a point, P0,</span>\
  \ <span m='1825000'>a point, P1, and I have two different paths</span> <span m='1828000'>that\
  \ go there, say, C1 and C2,</span> <span m='1833000'>so they go from the same point\
  \ to the same point but in</span> <span m='1839000'>different ways, then in this\
  \ situation,</span> <span m='1844000'>the line integral along C1 is equal to the\
  \ line integral along</span> <span m='1855000'>C2. Well, actually,</span> <span\
  \ m='1856000'>let me insist that this is only for gradient fields by putting</span>\
  \ <span m='1862000'>gradient F in here, just so you don't get tempted</span> <span\
  \ m='1869000'>to ever use this for a field that's not a gradient field --</span>\
  \ <span m='1879000'>-- if C1 and C2 have the same start and end point.</span> <span\
  \ m='1888000'>OK, how do you prove that? Well, it's very easy.</span> <span m='1890000'>We\
  \ just use the fundamental theorem.</span> <span m='1892000'>It tells us, if you\
  \ compute the line</span> <span m='1895000'>integral along C1, it's just F at this\
  \ point minus</span> <span m='1898000'>F at this point. If you do it for C2,</span>\
  \ <span m='1901000'>well, the same. So, they are the same.</span> <span m='1905000'>And\
  \ for that you don't actually even need to know what little f</span> <span m='1908000'>is.\
  \ You know in advance that it's</span> <span m='1910000'>going to be the same. So,\
  \ if I give you a vector</span> <span m='1913000'>field and I tell you it's the\
  \ gradient of mysterious function</span> <span m='1916000'>but I don't tell you\
  \ what the function is and you don't want</span> <span m='1918000'>to find out,\
  \ you can still use path</span> <span m='1920000'>independence, but only if you\
  \ know it's a</span> <span m='1923000'>gradient.</span> <span m='1945000'>OK, I\
  \ guess this one is dead. So, that will stay here forever</span> <span m='1955000'>because\
  \ nobody is tall enough to erase it.</span> <span m='1960000'>When you come back\
  \ next year and you still see that formula,</span> <span m='1969000'>you'll see.\
  \ Yes, but there's no useful</span> <span m='1973000'>information here. That's a\
  \ good point.</span> <span m='1979000'>OK, so what's another consequence?</span>\
  \ <span m='1986000'>So, if you have a gradient field, it's what's called</span>\
  \ <span m='1994000'>conservative. OK, so what a conservative</span> <span m='1999000'>field?\
  \ Well, the word conservative</span> <span m='2001000'>comes from the idea in physics;\
  \ if the conservation of energy.</span> <span m='2006000'>It tells you that you\
  \ cannot get energy for free out of your</span> <span m='2011000'>force field. So,</span>\
  \ <span m='2013000'>what it means is that in particular,</span> <span m='2016000'>if\
  \ you take a closed trajectory,</span> <span m='2019000'>so a trajectory that goes\
  \ from some point back to the same</span> <span m='2024000'>point, so, if C is a\
  \ closed curve,</span> <span m='2032000'>then the work done along C -- -- is zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='2043000'>OK, that's the definition of what it means to be</span> <span\
  \ m='2046000'>conservative. If I take any closed curve,</span> <span m='2049000'>the\
  \ work will always be zero. On the contrary,</span> <span m='2053000'>not conservative\
  \ means somewhere there is a curve along</span> <span m='2057000'>which the work\
  \ is not zero. If you find a curve where the</span> <span m='2061000'>work is zero,\
  \ that's not enough to say it's</span> <span m='2063000'>conservative. You have\
  \ show that no matter</span> <span m='2066000'>what curve I give you, if it's a\
  \ closed curve,</span> <span m='2070000'>it will always be zero. So, what that means\
  \ concretely</span> <span m='2074000'>is if you have a force field that conservative,</span>\
  \ <span m='2077000'>then you cannot build somehow some perpetual motion out of it.</span>\
  \ <span m='2082000'>You can't build something that will just keep going just</span>\
  \ <span m='2084000'>powered by that force because that force is actually not</span>\
  \ <span m='2087000'>providing any energy. After you've gone one loop</span> <span\
  \ m='2090000'>around, nothings happened from the point of view of the energy</span>\
  \ <span m='2093000'>provided by that force. There's no work coming from the</span>\
  \ <span m='2097000'>force, while if you have a force field</span> <span m='2099000'>that's\
  \ not conservative than you can try to actually maybe find a</span> <span m='2102000'>loop\
  \ where the work would be positive.</span> <span m='2104000'>And then, you know,\
  \ that thing will just keep</span> <span m='2107000'>running. So actually,</span>\
  \ <span m='2108000'>if you just look at magnetic fields and transformers or power</span>\
  \ <span m='2113000'>adapters, and things like that,</span> <span m='2115000'>you\
  \ precisely extract energy from the magnetic field.</span> <span m='2118000'>Of\
  \ course, I mean, you actually have to take some</span> <span m='2120000'>power\
  \ supply to maintain the magnetic fields.</span> <span m='2122000'>But, so a magnetic\
  \ field, you could actually try to get</span> <span m='2125000'>energy from it almost\
  \ for free. A gravitational field or an</span> <span m='2131000'>electric field,\
  \ you can't.</span> <span m='2135000'>OK, so and now why does that hold?</span>\
  \ <span m='2141000'>Well, if I have a gradient field,</span> <span m='2143000'>then\
  \ if I try to compute this line integral,</span> <span m='2147000'>I know it will\
  \ be the value of the function at the end point</span> <span m='2150000'>minus the\
  \ value at the starting point.</span> <span m='2152000'>But, they are the same.\
  \ So, the value is the same.</span> <span m='2164000'>So, if I have a gradient field,\
  \ and I do the line integral,</span> <span m='2169000'>then I will get f at the\
  \ endpoint minus f at the starting</span> <span m='2173000'>point. But, they're\
  \ the same point,</span> <span m='2183000'>so that's zero. OK, so just to reinforce\
  \ my</span> <span m='2192000'>warning that not every field is a gradient field,</span>\
  \ <span m='2198000'>let's look again at our favorite vector field from</span> <span\
  \ m='2205000'>yesterday. So, our favorite vector field</span> <span m='2209000'>yesterday\
  \ was negative y and x. It's a vector field that just</span> <span m='2214000'>rotates\
  \ around the origin counterclockwise.</span> <span m='2219000'>Well, we said, say\
  \ you take just the unit</span> <span m='2227000'>circle -- -- for example, counterclockwise.</span>\
  \ <span m='2237000'>Well, remember we said yesterday that the line integral</span>\
  \ <span m='2243000'>of F dr, maybe I should say F dot T ds now,</span> <span m='2248000'>because\
  \ the vector field is tangent to the circle.</span> <span m='2254000'>So, on the\
  \ unit circle, F is tangent to the curve.</span> <span m='2263000'>And so, F dot\
  \ T is length F times, well, length T.</span> <span m='2269000'>But, T is a unit\
  \ vector. So, it's length F.</span> <span m='2273000'>And, the length of F on the\
  \ unit circle was just one.</span> <span m='2277000'>So, that's the integral of\
  \ 1 ds. So, it's just the length of the</span> <span m='2282000'>circle that's 2\
  \ pi. And 2 pi is definitely not zero.</span> <span m='2287000'>So, this vector\
  \ field is not conservative.</span> <span m='2293000'>And so, now we know actually\
  \ it's not the gradient of</span> <span m='2297000'>anything because if it were\
  \ a gradient, then it would be</span> <span m='2302000'>conservative and it's not.\
  \ So, it's an example of a vector</span> <span m='2308000'>field that is not conservative.\
  \ It's not path independent</span> <span m='2313000'>either by the way because,\
  \ see, if I go from here to here</span> <span m='2318000'>along the upper half circle\
  \ or along the lower half circle,</span> <span m='2323000'>in one case I will get\
  \ pi. In the other case I will get</span> <span m='2326000'>negative pi. I don't\
  \ get the same answer,</span> <span m='2329000'>and so on, and so on. It just fails\
  \ to have all of</span> <span m='2334000'>these properties. So, maybe I will write\
  \ that</span> <span m='2339000'>down. It's not conservative,</span> <span m='2346000'>not\
  \ path independent. It's not a gradient.</span> <span m='2361000'>It doesn't have\
  \ any of these properties.</span> <span m='2369000'>OK, any questions? Yes?</span>\
  \ <span m='2378000'>How do you determine whether something is a gradient or not?</span>\
  \ <span m='2380000'>Well, that's what we will see on Tuesday.</span> <span m='2384000'>Yes?\
  \ Is it possible that it's</span> <span m='2390000'>conservative and not path independent,\
  \ or vice versa?</span> <span m='2392000'>The answer is no; these two properties\
  \ are</span> <span m='2394000'>equivalent, and we are going to see that right now.</span>\
  \ <span m='2397000'>At least that's the plan. OK, yes?</span> <span m='2412000'>Let's\
  \ see, so you said if it's not path independent,</span> <span m='2415000'>then we\
  \ cannot draw level curves that are perpendicular to</span> <span m='2419000'>it\
  \ at every point. I wouldn't necessarily go that</span> <span m='2423000'>far. You\
  \ might be able to draw</span> <span m='2425000'>curves that are perpendicular to\
  \ it.</span> <span m='2427000'>But they won't be the level curves of a function\
  \ for which</span> <span m='2432000'>this is the gradient. I mean, you might still\
  \ have,</span> <span m='2434000'>you know, if you take, say,</span> <span m='2436000'>take\
  \ his gradient field and scale it that in strange ways,</span> <span m='2440000'>you\
  \ know, multiply by two in some places,</span> <span m='2442000'>by one in other\
  \ places, by five and some other places,</span> <span m='2445000'>you will get something\
  \ that won't be conservative anymore.</span> <span m='2448000'>And it will still\
  \ be perpendicular to the curves.</span> <span m='2451000'>So, it's more subtle\
  \ than that, but certainly if it's not</span> <span m='2456000'>conservative then\
  \ it's not a gradient, and you cannot do what</span> <span m='2461000'>we said.\
  \ And how to decide whether it is</span> <span m='2464000'>or not, they'll be Tuesday's\
  \ topic.</span> <span m='2466000'>So, for now, I just want to figure out again</span>\
  \ <span m='2477000'>actually, let's now state all these properties -- Actually,</span>\
  \ <span m='2491000'>let me first do one minute of physics.</span> <span m='2501000'>So,\
  \ let me just tell you again what's the physics in here.</span> <span m='2508000'>So,\
  \ it's a force field is the gradient of a potential -- --</span> <span m='2520000'>so,\
  \ I'll still keep my plus signs.</span> <span m='2527000'>So, maybe I should say\
  \ this is minus physics.</span> <span m='2533000'>[LAUGHTER] So, the work of F is\
  \ the change</span> <span m='2540000'>in value of potential from one endpoint to\
  \ the other endpoint.</span> <span m='2551000'>[PAUSE ] And -- -- so, you know,\
  \ you might know about</span> <span m='2565000'>gravitational fields, or electrical\
  \ -- -- fields</span> <span m='2578000'>versus gravitational -- -- or electrical\
  \ potential.</span> <span m='2593000'>And, in case you haven't done any 8.02 yet,</span>\
  \ <span m='2596000'>electrical potential is also commonly known as voltage.</span>\
  \ <span m='2599000'>It's the one that makes it hurt when you stick your fingers\
  \ into</span> <span m='2607000'>the socket. [LAUGHTER] Don't try it.</span> <span\
  \ m='2613000'>OK, and so now, conservativeness means no</span> <span m='2625000'>energy\
  \ can be extracted for free -- -- from the field.</span> <span m='2641000'>You can't\
  \ just have, you know, a particle moving in that field</span> <span m='2645000'>and\
  \ going on in definitely, faster and faster,</span> <span m='2648000'>or if there's\
  \ actually friction,</span> <span m='2651000'>then keep moving. So, total energy\
  \ is conserved.</span> <span m='2665000'>And, I guess, that's why we call that</span>\
  \ <span m='2669000'>conservative. OK, so let's end with the recap</span> <span m='2683000'>of\
  \ various equivalent properties.</span> <span m='2697000'>OK, so the first property\
  \ that I will have for a vector field</span> <span m='2704000'>is that it's conservative.\
  \ So, to say that a vector field</span> <span m='2712000'>with conservative means\
  \ that the line integral is zero along any</span> <span m='2722000'>closed curve.\
  \ Maybe to clarify,</span> <span m='2726000'>sorry, along all closed curves, OK,\
  \ every closed curve;</span> <span m='2732000'>give me any closed curve, I get zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='2736000'>So, now I claim this is the same thing as a second property,</span>\
  \ <span m='2744000'>which is that the line integral of F is path independent.</span>\
  \ <span m='2753000'>OK, so that means if I have two paths with the same endpoint,</span>\
  \ <span m='2756000'>then I will get always the same answer.</span> <span m='2758000'>Why\
  \ is that equivalent? Well, let's say that I am path</span> <span m='2763000'>independent.\
  \ If I am path independent,</span> <span m='2766000'>then if I take a closed curve,\
  \ well, it has the same endpoints</span> <span m='2770000'>as just the curve that\
  \ doesn't move at all.</span> <span m='2773000'>So, path independence tells me instead\
  \ of going all around,</span> <span m='2776000'>I could just stay where I am. And\
  \ then, the work would just</span> <span m='2781000'>be zero. So, if I path independent,</span>\
  \ <span m='2784000'>tonight conservative. Conversely, let's say that I'm</span>\
  \ <span m='2788000'>just conservative and I want to check path independence.</span>\
  \ <span m='2792000'>Well, so I have two points, and then I had to paths between</span>\
  \ <span m='2797000'>that. I want to show that the work is</span> <span m='2799000'>the\
  \ same. Well, how I do that?</span> <span m='2803000'>C1 and C2, well, I observe\
  \ that if I do C1 minus</span> <span m='2809000'>C2, I get a closed path. If I go\
  \ first from here to</span> <span m='2814000'>here, and then back along that one,\
  \ I get a closed path.</span> <span m='2817000'>So, if I am conservative, I should\
  \ get zero.</span> <span m='2821000'>But, if I get zero on C1 minus C2, it means\
  \ that the work on C1</span> <span m='2825000'>and the work on C2 are the same.\
  \ See, so it's the same.</span> <span m='2830000'>It's just a different way to think\
  \ about the situation.</span> <span m='2839000'>More things that are equivalent,\
  \ I have two more</span> <span m='2844000'>things to say. The third one,</span>\
  \ <span m='2849000'>it's equivalent to F being a gradient field.</span> <span m='2858000'>OK,\
  \ so this is equivalent to the third property.</span> <span m='2866000'>F is a gradient\
  \ field. Why?</span> <span m='2879000'>Well, if we know that it's a gradient field,</span>\
  \ <span m='2882000'>that we've seen that we get these properties out of the</span>\
  \ <span m='2885000'>fundamental theorem. The question is,</span> <span m='2888000'>if\
  \ I have a conservative, or path independent vector</span> <span m='2892000'>field,\
  \ why is it the gradient of something?</span> <span m='2895000'>OK, so this way\
  \ is a fundamental theorem.</span> <span m='2905000'>That way, well, so that actually,</span>\
  \ <span m='2911000'>let me just say that will be how we find the potential.</span>\
  \ <span m='2923000'>So, how do we find potential? Well, let's say that I know the</span>\
  \ <span m='2926000'>value of my potential here. Actually, I get to choose what</span>\
  \ <span m='2929000'>it is. Remember, in physics,</span> <span m='2931000'>the potential\
  \ is defined up to adding or subtracting a</span> <span m='2933000'>constant. What\
  \ matters is only the change</span> <span m='2936000'>in potential. So, let's say\
  \ I know my</span> <span m='2938000'>potential here and I want to know my potential\
  \ here.</span> <span m='2941000'>What do I do? Well, I take my favorite</span> <span\
  \ m='2944000'>particle and I move it from here to here.</span> <span m='2947000'>And,\
  \ I look at the work done. And that tells me how much</span> <span m='2950000'>potential\
  \ has changed. So, that tells me what the</span> <span m='2954000'>potential should\
  \ be here. And, this does not depend on my</span> <span m='2958000'>choice of path\
  \ because I've assumed that I'm path</span> <span m='2961000'>independence. So,\
  \ that's who we will do on</span> <span m='2965000'>Tuesday. And, let me just state\
  \ the</span> <span m='2969000'>fourth property that's the same. So, all that stuff\
  \ is the same</span> <span m='2976000'>as also four. If I look at M dx N dy is</span>\
  \ <span m='2982000'>what's called an exact differential.</span> <span m='2988000'>So,\
  \ what that means, an exact differential,</span> <span m='2992000'>means that it\
  \ can be put in the form df for some function,</span> <span m='2996000'>f, and just\
  \ reformulating this</span> <span m='2998000'>thing, right, because I'm saying I\
  \ can just</span> <span m='3002000'>put it in the form f sub x dx plus f sub y dy,</span>\
  \ <span m='3005000'>which means my vector field was a gradient field.</span> <span\
  \ m='3008000'>So, these things are really the same.</span> <span m='3013000'>OK,\
  \ so after the weekend, on Tuesday we will actually</span> <span m='3016000'>figure\
  \ out how to decide whether these things hold or not,</span> <span m='3019000'>and\
  \ how to find the potential.</span> </p>"
