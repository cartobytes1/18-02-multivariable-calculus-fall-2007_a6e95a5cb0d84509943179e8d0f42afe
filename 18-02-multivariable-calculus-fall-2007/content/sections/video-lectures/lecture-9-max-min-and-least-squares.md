  at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m=''23000''>Today we are going to see how to use what
  we saw last time</span> <span m=''28000''>about partial derivatives to handle minimization
  or</span> <span m=''33000''>maximization problems involving functions of several
  variables.</span> <span m=''41000''>Remember last time we said that when we have
  a function,</span> <span m=''44000''>say, of two variables, x and y, then we have
  actually two</span> <span m=''49000''>different derivatives, partial f, partial
  x,</span> <span m=''53000''>also called f sub x, the derivative with respect to</span>
  <span m=''62000''>x keeping y constant. And we have partial f,</span> <span m=''71000''>partial
  y, also called f sub y, where we vary y and we keep x</span> <span m=''81000''>as
  a constant. And now, one thing I didn''t</span> <span m=''86000''>have time to tell
  you about but hopefully you thought about in</span> <span m=''90000''>recitation
  yesterday, is the approximation formula</span> <span m=''97000''>that tells you
  what happens if you vary both x and y.</span> <span m=''107000''>f sub x tells us
  what happens if we change x a little bit,</span> <span m=''110000''>by some small
  amount delta x. f sub y tells us how f changes,</span> <span m=''113000''>if you
  change y by a small amount delta y.</span> <span m=''116000''>If we do both at the
  same time then the two effects will add up</span> <span m=''120000''>with each other,
  because you can imagine that</span> <span m=''122000''>first you will change x and
  then you will change y.</span> <span m=''125000''>Or the other way around. It doesn''t
  really matter.</span> <span m=''132000''>If we change x by a certain amount delta
  x,</span> <span m=''138000''>and if we change y by the amount delta y,</span> <span
  m=''143000''>and let''s say that we have z= f(x, y) then that changes by an</span>
  <span m=''152000''>amount which is approximately f sub x times delta x plus f sub
  y</span> <span m=''160000''>times delta y. And that is one of the most</span> <span
  m=''165000''>important formulas about partial derivatives.</span> <span m=''169000''>The
  intuition for this, again, is just the two effects</span> <span m=''174000''>of
  if I change x by a small amount and then I change y.</span> <span m=''178000''>Well,
  first changing x will modify f, how much does it</span> <span m=''182000''>modify
  f? The answer is the rate change</span> <span m=''186000''>is f sub x. And if I
  change y then the rate</span> <span m=''189000''>of change of f when I change y
  is f sub y.</span> <span m=''193000''>So all together I get this change as a value
  of f.</span> <span m=''197000''>And, of course, that is only an approximation</span>
  <span m=''199000''>formula. Actually, there would be higher</span> <span m=''202000''>order
  terms involving second and third derivatives and so on.</span> <span m=''208000''>One
  way to justify this -- Sorry.</span> <span m=''223000''>I was distracted by the
  microphone.</span> <span m=''227000''>OK. How do we justify this formula?</span>
  <span m=''235000''>Well, one way to think about it is in terms of tangent plane</span>
  <span m=''245000''>approximation. Let''s think about the tangent</span> <span m=''250000''>plane
  with regard to a function f.</span> <span m=''253000''>We have some pictures to
  show you.</span> <span m=''255000''>It will be easier if I show you pictures.</span>
  <span m=''260000''>Remember, partial f, partial x was obtained by</span> <span m=''264000''>looking
  at the situation where y is held constant.</span> <span m=''269000''>That means
  I am slicing the graph of f by a plane that is</span> <span m=''273000''>parallel
  to the x, z plane.</span> <span m=''275000''>And when I change x, z changes, and
  the slope of</span> <span m=''279000''>that is going to be the derivative with respect
  to x.</span> <span m=''284000''>Now, if I do the same in the other direction then
  I will have</span> <span m=''289000''>similarly the slope in a slice now parallel
  to the y,</span> <span m=''293000''>z plane that will be partial f, partial y.</span>
  <span m=''297000''>In fact, in each case, I have a line.</span> <span m=''300000''>And
  that line is tangent to the surface.</span> <span m=''302000''>Now, if I have two
  lines tangent to the surface,</span> <span m=''306000''>well, then together they
  determine for me the tangent</span> <span m=''309000''>plane to the surface. Let''s
  try to see how that works.</span> <span m=''318000''>We know that f sub x and f
  sub y are the slopes of two tangent</span> <span m=''328000''>lines to this plane,
  two tangent lines to the graph.</span> <span m=''337000''>And let''s write down
  the equations of these lines.</span> <span m=''339000''>I am not going to write
  parametric equations.</span> <span m=''341000''>I am going to write them in terms
  of x, y,</span> <span m=''345000''>z coordinates. Let''s say that partial f of a</span>
  <span m=''349000''>partial x at the given point is equal to a.</span> <span m=''353000''>That
  means that we have a line given by the following</span> <span m=''360000''>conditions.
  I am going to keep y constant</span> <span m=''365000''>equal to y0. And I am going
  to change x.</span> <span m=''367000''>And, as I change x, z will change at the
  rate that</span> <span m=''372000''>is equal to a. That would be z = 0 a(x - x0).</span>
  <span m=''382000''>That is how you would describe a line that, I guess,</span> <span
  m=''386000''>the one that is plotted in green here, been dissected with</span> <span
  m=''390000''>the slice parallel to the x, z plane.</span> <span m=''393000''>I hold
  y constant equal to y0. And z is a function of x that</span> <span m=''400000''>varies
  with a rate of a. And now if I look similarly at</span> <span m=''410000''>the other
  slice, let''s say that the partial with</span> <span m=''415000''>respect to y is
  equal to b, then I get another line which</span> <span m=''420000''>is obtained
  by the fact that z now will depend on y.</span> <span m=''426000''>And the rate
  of change with respect to y will be b.</span> <span m=''430000''>While x is held
  constant equal to x0.</span> <span m=''435000''>These two lines are both going to
  be in the tangent plane to</span> <span m=''439000''>the surface.</span> <span m=''460000''>They
  are both tangent to the graph of f and together they</span> <span m=''465000''>determine
  the plane.</span> <span m=''476000''>And that plane is just given by the formula
  z = z0 a( x - x0) b</span> <span m=''488000''>( y - y0). If you look at what happens
  --</span> <span m=''493000''>This is the equation of a plane. z equals constant
  times x plus</span> <span m=''499000''>constant times y plus constant. And if you
  look at what happens</span> <span m=''504000''>if I hold y constant and vary x,
  I will get the first line.</span> <span m=''508000''>If I hold x constant and vary
  y, I get the second line.</span> <span m=''513000''>Another way to do it, of course,</span>
  <span m=''514000''>would provide actually parametric equations of these</span> <span
  m=''517000''>lines, get vectors along them and then</span> <span m=''520000''>take
  the cross-product to get the normal vector to the plane.</span> <span m=''523000''>And
  then get this equation for the plane using the normal</span> <span m=''527000''>vector.
  That also works and it gives</span> <span m=''529000''>you the same formula. If
  you are curious of the</span> <span m=''533000''>exercise, do it again using parametrics
  and using</span> <span m=''537000''>cross-product to get the plane equation.</span>
  <span m=''541000''>That is how we get the tangent plane.</span> <span m=''543000''>And
  now what this approximation formula here says is that,</span> <span m=''546000''>in
  fact, the graph of a function is close to the tangent</span> <span m=''550000''>plane.
  If we were moving on the</span> <span m=''552000''>tangent plane, this would be
  an actual</span> <span m=''555000''>equality. Delta z would be a linear</span> <span
  m=''557000''>function of delta x and delta y. And the graph of a function is</span>
  <span m=''563000''>near the tangent plane, but is not quite the same,</span> <span
  m=''567000''>so it is only an approximation for small delta x and small</span> <span
  m=''573000''>delta y. The approximation formula says</span> <span m=''583000''>the
  graph of f is close to its tangent plane.</span> <span m=''597000''>And we can use
  that formula over here now to estimate how</span> <span m=''602000''>the value of
  f changes if I change x and y at the same time.</span> <span m=''608000''>Questions
  about that? Now that we have caught up with</span> <span m=''618000''>what we were
  supposed to see on Tuesday, I can tell you now</span> <span m=''623000''>about max
  and min problems.</span> <span m=''638000''>That is going to be an application of
  partial</span> <span m=''648000''>derivatives to look at optimization problems.</span>
  <span m=''660000''>Maybe ten years from now, when you have a real job,</span> <span
  m=''663000''>your job might be to actually minimize the cost of something</span>
  <span m=''667000''>or maximize the profit of something or whatever.</span> <span
  m=''671000''>But typically the function that you will have to strive to</span> <span
  m=''674000''>minimize or maximize will depend on several variables.</span> <span
  m=''678000''>If you have a function of one variable, you know that to find</span>
  <span m=''682000''>its minimum or its maximum you look at the derivative and set</span>
  <span m=''686000''>that equal to zero. And you try to then look at</span> <span
  m=''689000''>what happens to the function. Here it is going to be kind of</span>
  <span m=''698000''>similar, except, of course, we have several</span> <span m=''707000''>derivatives.
  For today we will think about a</span> <span m=''711000''>function of two variables,
  but it works exactly the same</span> <span m=''716000''>if you have three variables,
  ten variables,</span> <span m=''720000''>a million variables. The first observation
  is that</span> <span m=''727000''>if we have a local minimum or a local maximum
  then both partial</span> <span m=''737000''>derivatives, so partial f partial x
  and</span> <span m=''741000''>partial f partial y, are both zero at the same time.</span>
  <span m=''746000''>Why is that? Well, let''s say that f of x is</span> <span m=''750000''>zero.
  That means when I vary x to</span> <span m=''752000''>first order the function doesn''t
  change.</span> <span m=''755000''>Maybe that is because it is going through...</span>
  <span m=''757000''>If I look only at the slice parallel to the x-axis then</span>
  <span m=''762000''>maybe I am going through the minimum.</span> <span m=''765000''>But
  if partial f, partial y is not 0 then</span> <span m=''768000''>actually, by changing
  y, I could still make a value</span> <span m=''771000''>larger or smaller. That
  wouldn''t be an actual</span> <span m=''774000''>maximum or minimum. It would only
  be a maximum or</span> <span m=''777000''>minimum if I stay in the slice. But if
  I allow myself to change</span> <span m=''781000''>y that doesn''t work. I need
  actually to know that if</span> <span m=''784000''>I change y the value will not
  change either to first order.</span> <span m=''787000''>That is why you also need
  partial f, partial y to be zero.</span> <span m=''791000''>Now, let''s say that
  they are both zero.</span> <span m=''793000''>Well, why is that enough? It is essentially
  enough</span> <span m=''796000''>because of this formula telling me that if both
  of these guys</span> <span m=''800000''>are zero then to first order the function
  doesn''t change.</span> <span m=''804000''>Then, of course, there will be maybe
  quadratic</span> <span m=''806000''>terms that will actually turn that, you know,</span>
  <span m=''808000''>this won''t really say that your function is actually constant.</span>
  <span m=''811000''>It will just tell you that maybe it will actually be</span> <span
  m=''815000''>quadratic or higher order in delta x and delta y.</span> <span m=''820000''>That
  is what you expect to have at a maximum or a minimum.</span> <span m=''832000''>The
  condition is the same thing as saying that the tangent plane</span> <span m=''845000''>to
  the graph is actually going to be horizontal.</span> <span m=''855000''>And that
  is what you want to have.</span> <span m=''858000''>Say you have a minimum, well,
  the tangent plane at this</span> <span m=''863000''>point, at the bottom of the
  graph is going to be horizontal.</span> <span m=''870000''>And you can see that
  on this equation of a tangent plane,</span> <span m=''875000''>when both these coefficients
  are 0 that is when the equation</span> <span m=''880000''>becomes z equals constant:
  the horizontal plane.</span> <span m=''884000''>Does that make sense? We will have
  a name for this</span> <span m=''890000''>kind of point because, actually,</span>
  <span m=''892000''>what we will see very soon is that these conditions are</span>
  <span m=''895000''>necessary but are not sufficient.</span> <span m=''897000''>There
  are actually other kinds of points where the partial</span> <span m=''902000''>derivatives
  are zero. Let''s give a name to this.</span> <span m=''908000''>We say the definition
  is (x0, y0) is a critical point of f --</span> <span m=''924000''>-- if the partial
  derivative, with respect to x,</span> <span m=''936000''>and partial derivative
  with respect to y are both zero.</span> <span m=''944000''>Generally, you would
  want all the partial derivatives,</span> <span m=''950000''>no matter how many variables
  you have, to be zero at the same</span> <span m=''956000''>time. Let''s see an example.</span>
  <span m=''966000''>Let''s say I give you the function f(x;y)= x^2 - 2xy 3y^2</span>
  <span m=''983000''>2x - 2y. And let''s try to figure out</span> <span m=''988000''>whether
  we can minimize or maximize this.</span> <span m=''992000''>What we would start
  doing immediately is taking the</span> <span m=''997000''>partial derivatives. What
  is f sub x?</span> <span m=''1003000''>It starts with 2x - 2y 0 2. Remember that
  y is a constant</span> <span m=''1016000''>so this differentiates to zero. Now,
  if we do f sub y,</span> <span m=''1024000''>that is going to be 0-2x 6y-2. And
  what we want to do is set</span> <span m=''1034000''>these things to zero. And we
  want to solve these two</span> <span m=''1037000''>equations at the same time. An
  important thing to remember,</span> <span m=''1041000''>and maybe I should have
  told you a couple of weeks ago</span> <span m=''1043000''>already, if you have two
  equations to</span> <span m=''1045000''>solve, well, it is very good to try to</span>
  <span m=''1048000''>simplify them by adding them together or whatever,</span> <span
  m=''1050000''>but you must keep two equations. If you have two equations,</span>
  <span m=''1053000''>you shouldn''t end up with just one equation out of nowhere.</span>
  <span m=''1057000''>For example here, we can certainly simplify</span> <span m=''1060000''>things
  by summing them together. If we add them together,</span> <span m=''1066000''>well,
  the x''s cancel and the constants cancel.</span> <span m=''1072000''>In fact, we
  are just left with 4y for zero.</span> <span m=''1076000''>That is pretty good.
  That tells us y should be zero.</span> <span m=''1080000''>But then we should, of
  course, go back to these and</span> <span m=''1082000''>see what else we know. Well,
  now it tells us,</span> <span m=''1087000''>if you put y = 0 it tells you 2x 2 =
  0.</span> <span m=''1094000''>That tells you x = - 1. We have one critical point
  that</span> <span m=''1106000''>is (x, y) = (- 1; 0).</span> <span m=''1113000''>Any
  questions so far? No.</span> <span m=''1119000''>Well, you should have a question.</span>
  <span m=''1120000''>The question should be how do we know if it is a maximum or
  a</span> <span m=''1129000''>minimum? Yeah.</span> <span m=''1133000''>If we had
  a function of one variable, we would decide things</span> <span m=''1135000''>based
  on the second derivative. And, in fact,</span> <span m=''1138000''>we will see tomorrow
  how to do things based on the second</span> <span m=''1140000''>derivative. But
  that is kind of tricky</span> <span m=''1143000''>because there are a lot of second
  derivatives.</span> <span m=''1146000''>I mean we already have two first derivatives.</span>
  <span m=''1149000''>You can imagine that if you keep taking partials you may end</span>
  <span m=''1154000''>up with more and more, so we will have to figure out</span>
  <span m=''1157000''>carefully what the condition should be.</span> <span m=''1159000''>We
  will do that tomorrow. For now, let''s just try to look</span> <span m=''1167000''>a
  bit at how do we understand these things by hand?</span> <span m=''1178000''>In
  fact, let me point out to you immediately that there is</span> <span m=''1182000''>more
  than maxima and minima. Remember, we saw the example of</span> <span m=''1189000''>x^2
  y^2. That has a critical point.</span> <span m=''1192000''>That critical point is
  obviously a minimum.</span> <span m=''1196000''>And, of course, it could be a local
  minimum</span> <span m=''1198000''>because it could be that if you have a more complicated
  function</span> <span m=''1201000''>there is indeed a minimum here, but then elsewhere
  the function</span> <span m=''1204000''>drops to a lower value. We call that just
  a local</span> <span m=''1208000''>minimum to say that it is a minimum if you stick
  two values</span> <span m=''1212000''>that are close enough to that point.</span>
  <span m=''1215000''>Of course, you also have local maximum, which I didn''t plot,</span>
  <span m=''1219000''>but it is easy to plot. That is a local maximum.</span> <span
  m=''1223000''>But there is a third example of critical point,</span> <span m=''1227000''>and
  that is a saddle point. The saddle point,</span> <span m=''1231000''>it is a new
  phenomena that you don''t really see in single</span> <span m=''1235000''>variable
  calculus. It is a critical point that is</span> <span m=''1238000''>neither a minimum
  nor a maximum because, depending on which</span> <span m=''1242000''>direction you
  look in, it''s either one or the other.</span> <span m=''1246000''>See the point
  in the middle, at the origin,</span> <span m=''1250000''>is a saddle point. If you
  look at the tangent</span> <span m=''1255000''>plane to this graph, you will see
  that it is</span> <span m=''1258000''>actually horizontal at the origin.</span>
  <span m=''1261000''>You have this mountain pass where the ground is horizontal.</span>
  <span m=''1265000''>But, depending on which direction you go,</span> <span m=''1268000''>you
  go up or down. So, we say that a point is a</span> <span m=''1272000''>saddle point
  if it is neither a minimum or a maximum.</span> <span m=''1290000''>Possibilities
  could be a local min, a local max or a saddle.</span> <span m=''1298000''>Tomorrow
  we will see how to decide which one it is,</span> <span m=''1302000''>in general,
  using second derivatives.</span> <span m=''1306000''>For this time, let''s just
  try to do it by</span> <span m=''1310000''>hand. I just want to observe,</span>
  <span m=''1313000''>in fact, I can try to, you know,</span> <span m=''1317000''>these
  examples that I have here,</span> <span m=''1318000''>they are x^2 y^2, y^2 - x^2,
  they are sums or differences of</span> <span m=''1322000''>squares. And, if we know
  that we can put</span> <span m=''1325000''>things as sum of squares for example,
  we will be done.</span> <span m=''1328000''>Let''s try to express this maybe as
  the square of something.</span> <span m=''1336000''>The main problem is this 2xy.
  Observe we know something that</span> <span m=''1341000''>starts with x^2 - 2xy
  but is actually a square of something</span> <span m=''1346000''>else. It would
  be x^2 - 2xy y^2,</span> <span m=''1352000''>not plus 3y2. Let''s try that.</span>
  <span m=''1357000''>So, we are going to complete the square.</span> <span m=''1368000''>I
  am going to say it is x minus y squared, so it gives me the</span> <span m=''1373000''>first
  two terms and also the y2. Well, I still need to add two</span> <span m=''1381000''>more
  y^2, and I also need to add, of course,</span> <span m=''1389000''>the 2x and -
  2y. It is still not simple enough</span> <span m=''1395000''>for my taste. I can
  actually do better.</span> <span m=''1399000''>These guys look like a sum of squares,
  but here I have this</span> <span m=''1404000''>extra stuff, 2x - 2y. Well, that
  is 2 (x - y).</span> <span m=''1408000''>It looks like maybe we can modify this
  and make this into</span> <span m=''1412000''>another square. So, in fact,</span>
  <span m=''1416000''>I can simplify this further to (x - y 1)^2.</span> <span m=''1425000''>That
  would be (x - y)^2 2( x - y), and then there is a plus</span> <span m=''1431000''>one.
  Well, we don''t have a plus one</span> <span m=''1435000''>so let''s remove it by
  subtracting one.</span> <span m=''1440000''>And I still have my 2y^2. Do you see
  why this is the same</span> <span m=''1447000''>function? Yeah.</span> <span m=''1453000''>Again,
  if I expand x minus y plus one squared,</span> <span m=''1459000''>I get (x - y)^2
  2 (x - y) 1. But I will have minus one that</span> <span m=''1468000''>will cancel
  out and then I have a plus 2y^2.</span> <span m=''1474000''>Now, what I know is
  a sum of two squared minus one.</span> <span m=''1481000''>And this critical point,
  (x,y) = (-1;0),</span> <span m=''1484000''>that is actually when this is zero and
  that is zero,</span> <span m=''1489000''>so that is the smallest value. This is
  always greater or equal</span> <span m=''1495000''>to zero, the same with that one,
  so that is always at least</span> <span m=''1500000''>minus one. And minus one happens
  to be the</span> <span m=''1503000''>value at the critical point. So, it is a minimum.</span>
  <span m=''1513000''>Now, of course here I was very lucky.</span> <span m=''1516000''>I
  mean, generally, I couldn''t expect things to</span> <span m=''1519000''>simplify
  that much. In fact, I cheated.</span> <span m=''1521000''>I started from that, I
  expanded, and then that is</span> <span m=''1526000''>how I got my example. The
  general method will be a</span> <span m=''1530000''>bit different, but you will
  see it will</span> <span m=''1532000''>actually also involve completing squares.</span>
  <span m=''1534000''>Just there is more to it than what we have seen.</span> <span
  m=''1542000''>We will come back to this tomorrow.</span> <span m=''1548000''>Sorry?
  How do I know that this equals</span> <span m=''1556000''>-- How do I know that
  the whole function is greater or equal to</span> <span m=''1569000''>negative one?
  Well, I wrote f of x,</span> <span m=''1575000''>y as something squared plus 2y^2
  - 1.</span> <span m=''1580000''>This squared is always a positive number and not
  a</span> <span m=''1585000''>negative. It is a square.</span> <span m=''1587000''>The
  square of something is always non-negative.</span> <span m=''1590000''>Similarly,
  y^2 is also always non-negative.</span> <span m=''1594000''>So if you add something
  that is at least zero plus something</span> <span m=''1598000''>that is at least
  zero and you subtract one,</span> <span m=''1600000''>you get always at least minus
  one.</span> <span m=''1603000''>And, in fact, the only way you can get minus</span>
  <span m=''1608000''>one is if both of these guys are zero at the same time.</span>
  <span m=''1614000''>That is how I get my minimum. More about this tomorrow.</span>
  <span m=''1637000''>In fact, what I would like to tell you</span> <span m=''1640000''>about
  now instead is a nice application of min,</span> <span m=''1643000''>max problems
  that maybe you don''t think of as a min,</span> <span m=''1647000''>max problem
  that you will see. I mean you will think of it</span> <span m=''1651000''>that way
  because probably your calculator can do it for you or,</span> <span m=''1655000''>if
  not, your computer can do it for you.</span> <span m=''1657000''>But it is actually
  something where the theory is based on</span> <span m=''1662000''>minimization in
  two variables. Very often in experimental</span> <span m=''1667000''>sciences you
  have to do something called least-squares</span> <span m=''1672000''>intercalation.
  And what is that about?</span> <span m=''1681000''>Well, it is the idea that maybe
  you do some experiments and you</span> <span m=''1687000''>record some data. You
  have some data x and some</span> <span m=''1691000''>data y. And, I don''t know,</span>
  <span m=''1693000''>maybe, for example, x is -- Maybe your measuring</span> <span
  m=''1697000''>frogs and you''re trying to measure how bit the frog leg is</span>
  <span m=''1701000''>compared to the eyes of the frog,</span> <span m=''1703000''>or
  you''re trying to measure something.</span> <span m=''1706000''>And if you are doing
  chemistry then it could be how much you</span> <span m=''1710000''>put of some reactant
  and how much of the output product that</span> <span m=''1715000''>you wanted to
  synthesize generated.</span> <span m=''1717000''>All sorts of things. Make up your
  own example.</span> <span m=''1723000''>You measure basically, for various values
  of x,</span> <span m=''1726000''>what the value of y ends up being.</span> <span
  m=''1728000''>And then you like to claim these points are kind of</span> <span m=''1732000''>aligned.
  And, of course,</span> <span m=''1733000''>to a mathematician they are not aligned.</span>
  <span m=''1735000''>But, to an experimental scientist, that is evidence that</span>
  <span m=''1737000''>there is a relation between the two.</span> <span m=''1740000''>And
  so you want to claim -- And in your paper you will actually</span> <span m=''1743000''>draw
  a nice little line like that.</span> <span m=''1745000''>The functions depend linearly
  on each of them.</span> <span m=''1750000''>The question is how do we come up with
  that nice line that</span> <span m=''1755000''>passes smack in the middle of the
  points?</span> <span m=''1759000''>The question is, given experimental data xi,</span>
  <span m=''1767000''>yi -- Maybe I should actually be more precise.</span> <span
  m=''1776000''>You are given some experimental data.</span> <span m=''1777000''>You
  have data points x1, y1, x2, y2 and so on,</span> <span m=''1785000''>xn, yn, the
  question would be find the</span> <span m=''1792000''>"best fit" line of a form
  y equals ax b</span> <span m=''1800000''>that somehow approximates very well this
  data.</span> <span m=''1808000''>You can also use that right away to predict various
  things.</span> <span m=''1811000''>For example, if you look at your new</span> <span
  m=''1813000''>homework, actually the first problem asks</span> <span m=''1817000''>you
  to predict how many iPods will be on this planet in ten</span> <span m=''1822000''>years
  looking at past sales and how they behave.</span> <span m=''1828000''>One thing,
  right away, before you lose all the money</span> <span m=''1831000''>that you don''t
  have yet, you cannot use that to predict</span> <span m=''1835000''>the stock market.
  So, don''t try to use that to</span> <span m=''1839000''>make money. It doesn''t
  work.</span> <span m=''1852000''>One tricky thing here that I want to draw your
  attention to</span> <span m=''1858000''>is what are the unknowns here? The natural
  answer would be to</span> <span m=''1862000''>say that the unknowns are x and y.</span>
  <span m=''1863000''>That is not actually the case. We are not going to solve for</span>
  <span m=''1867000''>some x and y. I mean we have some values</span> <span m=''1869000''>given
  to us. And, when we are looking for</span> <span m=''1872000''>that line, we don''t
  really care about the perfect value of x.</span> <span m=''1876000''>What we care
  about is actually these coefficients a and b that</span> <span m=''1881000''>will
  tell us what the relation is between x and y.</span> <span m=''1886000''>In fact,
  we are trying to solve for a and b that will give us</span> <span m=''1890000''>the
  nicest possible line for these points.</span> <span m=''1894000''>The unknowns,
  in our equations,</span> <span m=''1896000''>will have to be a and b, not x and
  y.</span> <span m=''1931000''>The question really is find the "best"</span> <span
  m=''1940000''>a and b. And, of course,</span> <span m=''1943000''>we have to decide
  what we mean by best.</span> <span m=''1946000''>Best will mean that we minimize
  some function of a and b that</span> <span m=''1950000''>measures the total errors
  that we are making when we are</span> <span m=''1954000''>choosing this line compared
  to the experimental data.</span> <span m=''1958000''>Maybe, roughly speaking, it
  should measure how far these</span> <span m=''1963000''>points are from the line.
  But now there are various ways</span> <span m=''1969000''>to do it. And a lot of
  them are valid</span> <span m=''1972000''>they give you different answers. You have
  to decide what it is</span> <span m=''1977000''>that you prefer. For example,</span>
  <span m=''1979000''>you could measure the distance to the line by projecting</span>
  <span m=''1984000''>perpendicularly. Or you could measure instead,</span> <span
  m=''1988000''>for a given value of x, the difference between the</span> <span m=''1993000''>experimental
  value of y and the predicted one.</span> <span m=''1997000''>And that is often more
  relevant because these guys actually may</span> <span m=''2001000''>be expressed
  in different units. They are not the same type of</span> <span m=''2005000''>quantity.
  You cannot actually combine</span> <span m=''2009000''>them arbitrarily. Anyway,
  the convention is</span> <span m=''2012000''>usually we measure distance in this
  way.</span> <span m=''2014000''>Next, you could try to minimize the largest distance.</span>
  <span m=''2018000''>Say we look at who has the largest error and we make that</span>
  <span m=''2022000''>the smallest possible. The drawback of doing that is</span>
  <span m=''2024000''>experimentally very often you have one data point that is not</span>
  <span m=''2027000''>good because maybe you fell asleep in front of the</span> <span
  m=''2030000''>experiment. And so you didn''t measure the</span> <span m=''2033000''>right
  thing. You tend to want to not give</span> <span m=''2035000''>too much importance
  to some data point that is far away from the</span> <span m=''2039000''>others.
  Maybe instead you want to</span> <span m=''2042000''>measure the average distance
  or maybe you want to actually give</span> <span m=''2046000''>more weight to things
  that are further away.</span> <span m=''2049000''>And then you don''t want to do
  the distance with a square of</span> <span m=''2052000''>the distance. There are
  various possible</span> <span m=''2054000''>answers, but one of them gives us actually
  a particularly nice</span> <span m=''2058000''>formula for a and b. And so that
  is why it is the</span> <span m=''2062000''>universally used one. Here it says list
  squares.</span> <span m=''2067000''>That''s because we will measure, actually, the
  sum of the</span> <span m=''2071000''>squares of the errors. And why do we do that?</span>
  <span m=''2075000''>Well, part of it is because it looks good.</span> <span m=''2077000''>When
  you see this plot in scientific papers they really</span> <span m=''2082000''>look
  like the line is indeed the ideal line.</span> <span m=''2086000''>And the second
  reason is because actually the</span> <span m=''2089000''>minimization problem that
  we will get is particularly simple,</span> <span m=''2092000''>well-posed and easy
  to solve. So we will have a nice formula</span> <span m=''2097000''>for the best
  a and the best b. If you have a method that is</span> <span m=''2103000''>simple
  and gives you a good answer then that is probably</span> <span m=''2107000''>good.
  We have to define best.</span> <span m=''2109000''>Here it is in the sense of minimizing
  the total square</span> <span m=''2122000''>error. Or maybe I should say total</span>
  <span m=''2129000''>square deviation instead. What do I mean by this?</span> <span
  m=''2135000''>The deviation for each data point is the difference between</span>
  <span m=''2144000''>what you have measured and what you are predicting by your</span>
  <span m=''2152000''>model. That is the difference between</span> <span m=''2160000''>y1
  and axi plus b. Now, what we will do is try to</span> <span m=''2171000''>minimize
  the function capital D, which is just the sum for all</span> <span m=''2185000''>the
  data points of the square of a deviation.</span> <span m=''2196000''>Let me go over
  this again. This is a function of a and b.</span> <span m=''2200000''>Of course
  there are a lot of letters in here,</span> <span m=''2203000''>but xi and yi in
  real life there will be numbers given to</span> <span m=''2206000''>you. There will
  be numbers that you</span> <span m=''2208000''>have measured. You have measured
  all of this</span> <span m=''2211000''>data. They are just going to be</span> <span
  m=''2213000''>numbers. You put them in there and you</span> <span m=''2218000''>get
  a function of a and b. Any questions?</span> <span m=''2236000''>How do we minimize
  this function of a and b?</span> <span m=''2240000''>Well, let''s use your knowledge.
  Let''s actually look for a</span> <span m=''2247000''>critical point. We want to
  solve for partial d</span> <span m=''2254000''>over partial a= 0, partial d over
  partial b = 0.</span> <span m=''2262000''>That is how we look for critical points.</span>
  <span m=''2268000''>Let''s take the derivative of this with respect to a.</span>
  <span m=''2272000''>Well, the derivative of a sum is sum of the derivatives.</span>
  <span m=''2279000''>And now we have to take the derivative of this quantity</span>
  <span m=''2284000''>squared. Remember, we take the</span> <span m=''2287000''>derivative
  of the square. We take twice this quantity</span> <span m=''2291000''>times the
  derivative of what we are squaring.</span> <span m=''2295000''>We will get 2(yi
  - axi) b times the derivative of this with</span> <span m=''2306000''>respect to
  a. What is the derivative of this</span> <span m=''2310000''>with respect to a?
  Negative xi, exactly.</span> <span m=''2315000''>And so we will want this to be
  0.</span> <span m=''2318000''>And partial d over partial b, we do the same thing,</span>
  <span m=''2321000''>but different shading with respect to b instead of with</span>
  <span m=''2325000''>respect to a. Again, the sum of squares twice</span> <span m=''2330000''>yi
  minus axi equals b times the derivative of this with respect</span> <span m=''2338000''>to
  b is, I think, negative one.</span> <span m=''2342000''>Those are the equations
  we have to solve.</span> <span m=''2347000''>Well, let''s reorganize this a little
  bit.</span> <span m=''2364000''>The first equation. See, there are a''s and there</span>
  <span m=''2372000''>are b''s in these equations. I am going to just look at the</span>
  <span m=''2376000''>coefficients of a and b. If you have good eyes,</span> <span
  m=''2379000''>you can see probably that these are actually linear equations in</span>
  <span m=''2382000''>a and b. There is a lot of clutter with</span> <span m=''2385000''>all
  these x''s and y''s all over the place.</span> <span m=''2387000''>Let''s actually
  try to expand things and make that more</span> <span m=''2395000''>apparent. The
  first thing I will do is</span> <span m=''2399000''>actually get rid of these factors
  of two.</span> <span m=''2402000''>They are just not very important.</span> <span
  m=''2405000''>I can simplify things. Next, I am going to look at the</span> <span
  m=''2410000''>coefficient of a. I will get basically a times xi</span> <span m=''2415000''>squared.
  Let me just do it and should be</span> <span m=''2424000''>clear. I claim when we
  simplify this</span> <span m=''2433000''>we get xi squared times a plus xi times
  b minus xiyi.</span> <span m=''2446000''>And we set this equal to zero. Do you agree
  that this is what</span> <span m=''2453000''>we get when we expand that product?</span>
  <span m=''2457000''>Yeah. Kind of? OK. Let''s do the other one.</span> <span m=''2463000''>We
  just multiply by minus one, so we take the opposite of that</span> <span m=''2468000''>which
  would be axi plus b. I will write that as xia plus b</span> <span m=''2479000''>minus
  yi. Sorry. I forgot the n here.</span> <span m=''2485000''>And let me just reorganize
  that by actually putting all the a''s</span> <span m=''2490000''>together. That
  means I will have sum of</span> <span m=''2494000''>all the xi2 times a plus sum
  of xib minus sum of xiyi equal to</span> <span m=''2500000''>zero.</span> <span
  m=''2528000''>If I rewrite this, it becomes sum of xi2 times a</span> <span m=''2535000''>plus
  sum of the xi''s time b, and let me move the other guys</span> <span m=''2544000''>to
  the other side, equals sum of xiyi.</span> <span m=''2550000''>And that one becomes
  sum of xi times a.</span> <span m=''2557000''>Plus how many b''s do I get on this
  one?</span> <span m=''2561000''>I get one for each data point. When I sum them together,</span>
  <span m=''2565000''>I will get n. Very good.</span> <span m=''2568000''>N times
  b equals sum of yi. Now, this quantities look</span> <span m=''2576000''>scary,
  but they are actually just numbers.</span> <span m=''2578000''>For example, this
  one, you look at all your</span> <span m=''2581000''>data points. For each of them
  you take the</span> <span m=''2585000''>value of x and you just sum all these numbers
  together.</span> <span m=''2590000''>What you get, actually, is a linear system
  in</span> <span m=''2599000''>a and b, a two by two linear system.</span> <span
  m=''2606000''>And so now we can solve this for a and b.</span> <span m=''2612000''>In
  practice, of course, first you plug in</span> <span m=''2615000''>the numbers for
  xi and yi and then you solve the system that</span> <span m=''2620000''>you get.
  And we know how to solve two by</span> <span m=''2624000''>two linear systems, I
  hope.</span> <span m=''2626000''>That''s how we find the best fit line.</span> <span
  m=''2630000''>Now, why is that going to be the best one instead of the</span> <span
  m=''2634000''>worst one? We just solved for a critical</span> <span m=''2636000''>point.
  That could actually be a</span> <span m=''2638000''>maximum of this error function
  D.</span> <span m=''2641000''>We will have the answer to that next time, but trust
  me.</span> <span m=''2645000''>If you really want to go over the second derivative
  test that</span> <span m=''2648000''>we will see tomorrow and apply it in this case,</span>
  <span m=''2651000''>it is quite hard to check, but you can see it is actually</span>
  <span m=''2654000''>a minimum. I will just say -- -- we can</span> <span m=''2668000''>show
  that it is a minimum. Now, the event with the linear</span> <span m=''2682000''>case
  is the one that we are the most familiar with.</span> <span m=''2687000''>Least-squares
  interpolation actually works in much more</span> <span m=''2696000''>general settings.
  Because instead of fitting for</span> <span m=''2703000''>the best line, if you
  think it has a different</span> <span m=''2706000''>kind of relation then maybe
  you can fit in using a different</span> <span m=''2710000''>kind of formula. Let
  me actually illustrate that</span> <span m=''2714000''>with an example. I don''t
  know if you are</span> <span m=''2717000''>familiar with Moore''s law. It is something
  that is</span> <span m=''2721000''>supposed to tell you how quickly basically computer
  chips become</span> <span m=''2724000''>smarter faster and faster all the time.</span>
  <span m=''2727000''>It''s a law that says things about the number of transistors</span>
  <span m=''2731000''>that you can fit onto a computer chip.</span> <span m=''2733000''>Here
  I have some data about -- Here is data about the number of</span> <span m=''2745000''>transistors
  on a standard PC processor as a function of time.</span> <span m=''2758000''>And
  if you try to do a best-line fit,</span> <span m=''2761000''>well, it doesn''t seem
  to follow a linear trend.</span> <span m=''2767000''>On the other hand, if you plug
  the diagram in the</span> <span m=''2771000''>log scale, the log of a number of</span>
  <span m=''2773000''>transitions as a function of time,</span> <span m=''2775000''>then
  you get a much better line. And so, in fact,</span> <span m=''2781000''>that means
  that you had an exponential relation between the</span> <span m=''2786000''>number
  of transistors and time. And so, actually that''s what</span> <span m=''2790000''>Moore''s
  law says. It says that the number of</span> <span m=''2792000''>transistors in the
  chip doubles every 18 months or every two</span> <span m=''2796000''>years. They
  keep changing the</span> <span m=''2800000''>statement. How do we find the best</span>
  <span m=''2809000''>exponential fit? Well, an exponential fit would</span> <span
  m=''2818000''>be something of a form y equals a constant times exponential of</span>
  <span m=''2825000''>a times x. That is what we want to look at.</span> <span m=''2829000''>Well,
  we could try to minimize a square error like we did</span> <span m=''2833000''>before.
  That doesn''t work well at all.</span> <span m=''2836000''>The equations that you
  get are very complicated.</span> <span m=''2838000''>You cannot solve them. But
  remember what I showed you</span> <span m=''2844000''>on this log plot. If you plot
  the log of y as a</span> <span m=''2848000''>function of x then suddenly it becomes
  a linear relation.</span> <span m=''2853000''>Observe, this is the same as ln of
  y equals ln of c plus ax.</span> <span m=''2863000''>And that is the linear best
  fit. What you do is you just look</span> <span m=''2875000''>for the best straight
  line fit for the log of y.</span> <span m=''2888000''>That is something we already
  know.</span> <span m=''2890000''>But you can also do, for example,</span> <span
  m=''2892000''>let''s say that we have something more complicated.</span> <span m=''2896000''>Let''s
  say that we have actually a quadratic law.</span> <span m=''2901000''>For example,
  y is of the form ax^2 bx c.</span> <span m=''2907000''>And, of course, you are trying
  to find somehow</span> <span m=''2911000''>the best. That would mean here fitting</span>
  <span m=''2914000''>the best parabola for your data points.</span> <span m=''2917000''>Well,
  to do that, you would need to find a,</span> <span m=''2920000''>b and c. And now
  you will have actually</span> <span m=''2925000''>a function of a, b and c, which
  would be the sum</span> <span m=''2931000''>of the old data points of the square
  deviation.</span> <span m=''2937000''>And, if you try to solve for critical points,</span>
  <span m=''2941000''>now you will have three equations involving a,</span> <span
  m=''2943000''>b and c, in fact, you will find a three</span> <span m=''2945000''>by
  three linear system. And it works the same way.</span> <span m=''2949000''>Just
  you have a little bit more data.</span> <span m=''2954000''>Basically, you see that
  this best fit problems are an example</span> <span m=''2959000''>of a minimization
  problem that maybe you didn''t expect to see</span> <span m=''2964000''>minimization
  problems come in. But that is really the way to</span> <span m=''2970000''>handle
  these questions. Tomorrow we will go back to the</span> <span m=''2974000''>question
  of how do we decide whether it is a minimum or a</span> <span m=''2978000''>maximum.
  And we will continue exploring</span> <span m=''2980000''>in terms of several variables.</span>
