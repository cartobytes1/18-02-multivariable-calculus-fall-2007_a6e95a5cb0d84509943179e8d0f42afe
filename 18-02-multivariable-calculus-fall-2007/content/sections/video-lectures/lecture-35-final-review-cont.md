  <span m='23000'>I guess last time on Friday we went over the first half of the</span>
  <span m='28000'>class very quickly. And so today we are going to go</span> <span
  m='33000'>over the second half of the class very quickly.</span> <span m='38000'>And
  so that was stuff about double and triple integrals and</span> <span m='45000'>vector
  calculus in the plane and in space.</span> <span m='51000'>As usual, what is on
  the final is basically what was on the</span> <span m='55000'>other tests, exactly
  the same stuff.</span> <span m='57000'>Well, not the same problem, unfortunately.</span>
  <span m='63000'>The first thing we learned about was double integrals in</span>
  <span m='73000'>the plane and how to set up the bounds and how to evaluate them.</span>
  <span m='85000'>Just to remind you quickly, the important thing with</span> <span
  m='90000'>iterated integrals is when you integrate a function f of x,</span> <span
  m='94000'>y, say dy dx for example,</span> <span m='98000'>is that you have to draw
  a picture of a region.</span> <span m='101000'>Unless it is completely obvious you
  should really draw some</span> <span m='105000'>picture of the domain of integration.</span>
  <span m='108000'>And once you have that picture you can use it to find the</span>
  <span m='113000'>bounds. Remember the general method is</span> <span m='117000'>that
  we first look at the inner integral, here integral of f dy.</span> <span m='123000'>And
  in this inner integral the outer variable here,</span> <span m='127000'>x, is fixed.
  That means we are slicing our</span> <span m='130000'>region by a vertical line
  corresponding to a fixed value</span> <span m='133000'>of x. We fix a value of x.</span>
  <span m='136000'>And what we have to find out is the bounds for y,</span> <span
  m='140000'>so the value of y at this point, the value of y at that</span> <span
  m='144000'>point. Let me call that y some bottom</span> <span m='148000'>of x, in
  general depends on x. And this one will be y at that</span> <span m='154000'>top,
  and it also depends on x. And then the bounds for y would</span> <span m='163000'>be
  this. And then, when you look at the</span> <span m='166000'>outer bound, things
  are different.</span> <span m='168000'>Because there you expect to have just numbers,</span>
  <span m='171000'>no longer functions of anything.</span> <span m='173000'>And what
  you do is look at the shadow of your region.</span> <span m='176000'>We are doing
  it by shadow so you just project to the x-axis.</span> <span m='180000'>If you project
  to the x-axis your region will look like this.</span> <span m='184000'>Its shadow
  is going to be this integral form,</span> <span m='188000'>some minimum value of
  x to some maximum value of x.</span> <span m='192000'>And that will give us the
  bounds for the outer integral.</span> <span m='204000'>And then, to evaluate, we
  evaluate the usual way.</span> <span m='207000'>Speaking of evaluation, what you
  need to know for the</span> <span m='209000'>final, well, essentially the same kind</span>
  <span m='211000'>of evaluation techniques that we were supposed to know for the</span>
  <span m='215000'>other tests. That means the usual functions,</span> <span m='220000'>substitutions,
  basic trig, stuff like that.</span> <span m='227000'>Well, I don't expect that you
  would need integration by parts,</span> <span m='231000'>although I still hope that
  some of you remember it from single</span> <span m='234000'>variable calculus. If
  there is a need to integrate</span> <span m='239000'>some big power of cosine or
  sine then the formula will be given</span> <span m='246000'>to you the way it is
  in the notes.</span> <span m='251000'>And, of course, we know also how to set up</span>
  <span m='257000'>these integrals in polar coordinates.</span> <span m='263000'>And
  then the area element becomes r dr d theta.</span> <span m='268000'>And because
  you integrate first over r,</span> <span m='272000'>well, first of all you should
  remember the polar coordinate</span> <span m='276000'>formulas, namely x equals
  r cosine theta</span> <span m='282000'>and y equals r sine theta. And second you
  should remember</span> <span m='290000'>that what we do, when we have our region,</span>
  <span m='293000'>is for a fixed value of theta we look for the bounds for r,</span>
  <span m='296000'>just like before, so the way we are slicing the</span> <span m='299000'>region
  is now we are actually shooting rays straight from the</span> <span m='302000'>origin.
  And, in a given direction,</span> <span m='304000'>we are asking ourselves how far
  does my region go?</span> <span m='308000'>You have to find a bound and you have
  to find whatever the</span> <span m='312000'>value of r will be out here as a function
  of theta.</span> <span m='315000'>And ways to do that can be geometric or they can
  be by</span> <span m='319000'>starting from the x, y equation of whatever curve</span>
  <span m='322000'>you have and then expressing it in terms of r and theta and</span>
  <span m='326000'>solving for r. For example,</span> <span m='328000'>just to illustrate
  it, we have seen that one of our</span> <span m='333000'>classics has been the circle
  of radius one centered at one,</span> <span m='339000'>zero. This guy, you have
  two</span> <span m='342000'>different ways of getting its polar coordinate equation.</span>
  <span m='345000'>One is to argue geometrically that you have a right angle in</span>
  <span m='349000'>here. And this length is two,</span> <span m='351000'>this angle
  is theta, this length is r,</span> <span m='354000'>so the polar equation is r equals
  two cosine theta.</span> <span m='359000'>The other way to do it, if somehow you
  are missing the</span> <span m='361000'>geometric trick, is to start from the x,</span>
  <span m='363000'>y equation. What is the x,</span> <span m='365000'>y equation of
  this guy? Well, it is x minus one squared</span> <span m='370000'>plus y squared
  equals one. If you expand that you will get</span> <span m='376000'>x squared minus
  two x plus one plus y squared equals one.</span> <span m='382000'>The ones simplify.
  X squared plus y squared</span> <span m='387000'>becomes r squared minus two x becomes
  r cosine theta equals</span> <span m='394000'>zero. That gives you,</span> <span
  m='396000'>when you simplify by r, r equals two cosine theta.</span> <span m='400000'>Two
  ways to get the same polar equation.</span> <span m='409000'>I should say this is
  an example, in case you were</span> <span m='413000'>wondering what I was doing.
  We have also actually seen how</span> <span m='421000'>to change variables to more
  complicated coordinate systems.</span> <span m='434000'>Let's say u, v coordinates.
  But, of course,</span> <span m='436000'>you can call them whatever you want.</span>
  <span m='440000'>The main thing to remember is that you have to look for the</span>
  <span m='444000'>Jacobian which will give you the conversion ratio between dx dy</span>
  <span m='450000'>and du dv. For example,</span> <span m='452000'>if you know u and
  v as functions of x and y then you</span> <span m='456000'>will write du dv equals
  absolute value of the Jacobian partial u,</span> <span m='462000'>v over partial
  x, y times dx dy. Or, if it is easier for you,</span> <span m='470000'>you can do
  the Jacobian the other way around.</span> <span m='472000'>And this Jacobian, remember,
  is the determinant by</span> <span m='476000'>a two by two matrix that you obtain
  by putting the partial</span> <span m='480000'>derivatives of u and v with respect
  to x and y.</span> <span m='483000'>Then, when we have that, we can change the integrant,</span>
  <span m='488000'>f of x, y, into something involving u and v possibly.</span> <span
  m='493000'>And then we have to find the bounds.</span> <span m='495000'>And to find
  the bounds perhaps the easiest is to draw a picture</span> <span m='499000'>of a
  region in u, v coordinates.</span> <span m='501000'>Maybe you have some picture
  in the x,</span> <span m='504000'>y plane that might actually be really hard to
  draw and maybe in</span> <span m='508000'>terms of u and v the picture will become
  much simpler.</span> <span m='512000'>It might just become a rectangle.</span> <span
  m='515000'>Of course, if you see immediately what the bounds are</span> <span m='517000'>in
  terms of u and v, and they turn out to be very</span> <span m='519000'>easy, then
  maybe you don't even have</span> <span m='521000'>to draw this picture. But if it
  is not completely</span> <span m='525000'>obvious then that might be a helpful way
  of figuring out what</span> <span m='529000'>the bounds will be when you switch
  from x,</span> <span m='532000'>y to u, v. We have seen some problems like</span>
  <span m='535000'>that and there are more in the notes in case you need more.</span>
  <span m='540000'>Questions? Yes?</span> <span m='547000'>That is the second time
  you've asked for something real quick</span> <span m='550000'>in these review sessions.
  You are in a hurry.</span> <span m='553000'>Take your time. Partial u, v over partial
  x,</span> <span m='563000'>y is just going to be the determinant of u sub x,</span>
  <span m='566000'>u sub y, v sub x, v sub y.</span> <span m='569000'>That is the
  definition. That is pretty direct.</span> <span m='577000'>And, of course, a general
  common sense thing</span> <span m='579000'>that applies to actually all the integrals
  that we are going to</span> <span m='583000'>see, there are two things in an integral.</span>
  <span m='585000'>One is whatever you integral is called the integrant.</span> <span
  m='589000'>It could be a function here. It is a vector field in some of</span> <span
  m='592000'>the flux things and so on. There is another thing which is</span> <span
  m='595000'>the region over which you integrate.</span> <span m='597000'>And the
  two have strictly nothing to do with each other.</span> <span m='602000'>When you
  are given a piece of data in the statement of a</span> <span m='605000'>problem,
  you have to figure out whether</span> <span m='607000'>that is part of a function
  to be integrated or whether that is</span> <span m='609000'>part of the region of
  integration.</span> <span m='611000'>If it is the region of integration then it
  will go into</span> <span m='614000'>the bounds of the integral and maybe in the
  choice of the</span> <span m='617000'>coordinate system that you use for integrating.</span>
  <span m='619000'>While the function that you are integrating goes before the dx</span>
  <span m='623000'>dy and not into the bounds or anything like that.</span> <span
  m='626000'>I know it sounds kind of silly but it is a good safety check.</span>
  <span m='632000'>Ask yourselves, when you have a piece of data,</span> <span m='634000'>where
  in my formula should this go.</span> <span m='636000'>Yes? I case you want the bounds
  for</span> <span m='647000'>this region in polar coordinates, indeed it would be</span>
  <span m='650000'>double integral. For a fixed theta,</span> <span m='653000'>r goes
  from zero to whatever it is on that curve.</span> <span m='657000'>So it would be
  zero to two cosine theta of whatever the</span> <span m='664000'>function is r dr
  d theta. And the bounds on theta would</span> <span m='670000'>be from negative
  pi over two to pi over two.</span> <span m='675000'>We have seen that one several
  times, so hopefully by now it is</span> <span m='680000'>clearer. OK.</span> <span
  m='681000'>Let me move on a bit because we have a lot of other kinds of</span> <span
  m='688000'>integrals to see. Other kinds of integrals we</span> <span m='692000'>have
  seen are triple integrals. And I am not doing things in</span> <span m='695000'>the
  order that we did them in the class just so you can see</span> <span m='699000'>parallels
  between stuff in the plane and in space.</span> <span m='703000'>When we do triple
  integrals in space, well, it is the same kind</span> <span m='707000'>of story,
  except now we have, of course, more coordinate</span> <span m='710000'>systems.
  We have rectangular</span> <span m='713000'>coordinates, we have cylindrical coordinates
  and we have</span> <span m='719000'>spherical coordinates. And cylindrical coordinates</span>
  <span m='725000'>only mean that we are, instead of x, y and z,</span> <span m='729000'>we
  are replacing x and y by the polar coordinate in the x,</span> <span m='735000'>y
  plane, so the angle theta and the</span> <span m='737000'>distance r. So R is somehow
  the distance</span> <span m='741000'>from the z-axis and z is the height.</span>
  <span m='744000'>Usually you don't have to choose between rectangular and</span>
  <span m='748000'>cylindrical until somewhat late in the process,</span> <span m='751000'>especially
  if you integrate first of all z,</span> <span m='753000'>because then the choice
  will come up mostly when you try to</span> <span m='756000'>figure out what are
  the bounds for the shadow of your region.</span> <span m='759000'>I mean the z part
  looks exactly the same in rectangular and in</span> <span m='763000'>cylindrical.
  Spherical is,</span> <span m='765000'>on the other hand, a little bit more annoying</span>
  <span m='769000'>because it looks quite different.</span> <span m='772000'>You should
  think of it as doing polar coordinates not only in</span> <span m='776000'>the horizontal
  direction but also in the vertical direction</span> <span m='779000'>at the same
  time. You have this angle phi.</span> <span m='782000'>That measures the angle down
  from the positive z-axis.</span> <span m='786000'>And you have rho which is the
  distance from the origin.</span> <span m='790000'>And if I project to the z-axis,
  r becomes rho sine phi and z</span> <span m='799000'>becomes rho cosine phi. I hope
  that you all know these</span> <span m='804000'>two formulas, but if you ever have
  a small</span> <span m='807000'>somehow memory lapse during the final then you should
  consider</span> <span m='811000'>drawing this kind of picture because it will let
  you check</span> <span m='815000'>very quickly which one is sine, which one is cosine.</span>
  <span m='822000'>Now, of course, we have to have formulas for dv</span> <span m='824000'>in
  all these coordinate systems. Here, for example,</span> <span m='827000'>that might
  be dz r dr d theta or r dr d theta dz or anything</span> <span m='832000'>like that.
  Here it might be rho squared</span> <span m='838000'>times phi times d rho d phi
  d theta.</span> <span m='844000'>And the general method for setting up bounds is
  pretty much</span> <span m='847000'>the same as in the plane, just there is one
  more step.</span> <span m='850000'>If you are doing rectangular or cylindrical coordinates
  with z</span> <span m='854000'>first, for example, that is the most common.</span>
  <span m='856000'>Well, if you do z first then you have to actually start by</span>
  <span m='862000'>figuring out for a given value of x and y or r and theta what</span>
  <span m='868000'>is the portion of a vertical line above x,</span> <span m='871000'>y
  that lies within my region? That will go from z on the</span> <span m='877000'>bottom
  of my solid which depends on x and y to z at the top of my</span> <span m='884000'>solid
  which also usually will depend on x and y.</span> <span m='889000'>And so that will
  give me the bounds for dz.</span> <span m='892000'>And then I will be left with
  the shadow of my region in the</span> <span m='896000'>x, y plane. And that one
  I will set up like</span> <span m='902000'>a double integral over there. Strictly-speaking,</span>
  <span m='909000'>if you are curious, we could also change to weird</span> <span
  m='912000'>coordinate systems using Jacobian with three variables at</span> <span
  m='915000'>the same time. But we haven't seen that so it</span> <span m='918000'>won't
  be on the final. But it would work just the same</span> <span m='924000'>way, just
  with more pictures to do.</span> <span m='930000'>And, in fact, I just wanted to
  say this rho</span> <span m='933000'>squared sine phi is actually the Jacobian for
  the change of</span> <span m='937000'>variables for rectangular to spherical coordinates.</span>
  <span m='942000'>OK. Let's not think too much about</span> <span m='948000'>that.
  Applications.</span> <span m='951000'>Well, we have seen how to use double integrals
  to find the</span> <span m='957000'>area of a volume of a piece of a plane or a
  piece of space,</span> <span m='963000'>and find also the mass. Remember, area is
  just double</span> <span m='968000'>integral of one dA, volume is triple integral
  of</span> <span m='972000'>one dV. Sometimes if it's the volume</span> <span m='974000'>between
  the x, y plane and the graph of some</span> <span m='976000'>function, you can just
  set it up directly as a double integral.</span> <span m='979000'>But there is no
  harm in doing it as a triple integral if you</span> <span m='983000'>feel better
  about that. And mass will be double or</span> <span m='987000'>triple integral,
  depending on how many</span> <span m='991000'>dimensions you have, of whatever density
  function</span> <span m='996000'>you have, dA or dV. Then there is how to find the</span>
  <span m='1005000'>average value of some function. Well, let me do the</span> <span
  m='1013000'>three-dimensional case. You will just replace volume by</span> <span
  m='1018000'>area and dV by dA and so on, if need be.</span> <span m='1022000'>That
  would be one over volume of the solid times the triple</span> <span m='1029000'>integral
  of f dV, or if it's a weighted average,</span> <span m='1038000'>one over mass times
  the triple integral of a function times</span> <span m='1044000'>density times dV.
  If you don't have a density or</span> <span m='1053000'>if the density is constant
  then that reduces to that one.</span> <span m='1064000'>In particular, we have seen
  the notion of</span> <span m='1066000'>center of mass. The center of mass is just</span>
  <span m='1070000'>given by taking the average values of the coordinates,</span>
  <span m='1074000'>x bar, y bar, z bar.</span> <span m='1076000'>It is just this
  formula but taking x, y or z as the</span> <span m='1080000'>function. There are
  moments of inertia.</span> <span m='1088000'>For example, the moment of inertia
  about the</span> <span m='1092000'>z-axis is the triple integral of x squared plus
  y squared density</span> <span m='1097000'>dV. Or, if you have just a</span> <span
  m='1099000'>two-dimensional object, it is the same formula,</span> <span m='1102000'>but,
  of course, with dA.</span> <span m='1103000'>And then we call that the polar moment
  of inertia because we</span> <span m='1106000'>thought of it as rotating the plane
  about the origin,</span> <span m='1110000'>but the origin is just where the z-axis
  hits the x,</span> <span m='1114000'>y plane so it is really the same thing.</span>
  <span m='1118000'>And we have also seen gravitational attraction in</span> <span
  m='1122000'>space, and I will let you look at your notes for that.</span> <span
  m='1127000'>It is just one formula to remember.</span> <span m='1137000'>Questions
  about iterated integrals, things like that?</span> <span m='1142000'>Yes? The formula
  that you should</span> <span m='1158000'>know for gravitational attraction is that
  if yu have a</span> <span m='1162000'>point mass at the origin and you have some
  solid centered on the</span> <span m='1168000'>z-axis that is attracting it then
  the force will be given by</span> <span m='1173000'>G times the mass times the triple
  integral of density times</span> <span m='1178000'>cosine phi over rho squared times
  dV.</span> <span m='1182000'>And, of course, you will actually do that in</span>
  <span m='1185000'>spherical coordinates because it is easier that way.</span> <span
  m='1190000'>That is the formula I have in mind.</span> <span m='1195000'>But, see,
  all these formulas just give you examples of things</span> <span m='1199000'>to
  integrate. And how to set up the bounds</span> <span m='1201000'>and so on does
  not depend on what you are actually</span> <span m='1203000'>integrating. It is
  done always using the</span> <span m='1208000'>same methods. Let's move on to work
  and line</span> <span m='1222000'>integrals. We have seen how to do that in</span>
  <span m='1228000'>the plane and in space. And it looks very similar</span> <span
  m='1235000'>somehow. Remember, you have to know how</span> <span m='1241000'>to
  set up and evaluate a line integral of this form.</span> <span m='1248000'>Let me
  do it in the plane this time.</span> <span m='1249000'>If you are in the plane you
  have two components,</span> <span m='1253000'>and then this becomes the line integral
  of M dx plus N dy.</span> <span m='1258000'>If you have a space curve then you will
  have a third component</span> <span m='1261000'>here. You will add that guy times
  dz.</span> <span m='1265000'>Now, how do we evaluate that? Well, it is very different
  from</span> <span m='1268000'>there because here we are just on a curve so there
  should be</span> <span m='1271000'>only one degree of freedom. One variable should
  be enough</span> <span m='1275000'>to know where we are. We will have to express
  x and y</span> <span m='1281000'>in terms of -- Well, I should and z optionally
  if</span> <span m='1288000'>there is one, in terms of a single</span> <span m='1292000'>parameters.
  And that might be just one of</span> <span m='1296000'>the coordinates. If you are
  told y equals z</span> <span m='1298000'>squared, that is easy. You just substitute
  y equals x</span> <span m='1301000'>squared and dy equals two x dx into everything,</span>
  <span m='1304000'>and you are left with an integral over x.</span> <span m='1308000'>Maybe
  it will be something in terms of time or in terms of an</span> <span m='1321000'>angle.
  We express everything in terms</span> <span m='1325000'>of a single parameter, and
  that will give us a usual</span> <span m='1329000'>single integral. Any questions
  about that?</span> <span m='1334000'>Yes? If you cannot parameterize the</span>
  <span m='1343000'>curve then it is really, really hard to evaluate the</span> <span
  m='1347000'>line integral. Well, you might be able to</span> <span m='1351000'>evaluate
  it numerically into a computer, but that is the</span> <span m='1355000'>easiest
  way to describe a curve. Indeed it could be that in the</span> <span m='1360000'>plane
  you have an equation in terms of x and y given by some</span> <span m='1363000'>completed
  formulas defining some curve.</span> <span m='1366000'>Then actually there are ways
  you can use basically</span> <span m='1369000'>differentials and constrained partials
  to figure out what the</span> <span m='1372000'>tangent vector to the curve is and
  so on.</span> <span m='1375000'>But we haven't really seen how to do that.</span>
  <span m='1377000'>That would be a really nice topic for tying together the end</span>
  <span m='1380000'>of the second unit that we discussed last time,</span> <span m='1382000'>constrained
  partials, with this stuff.</span> <span m='1384000'>But that is not going to be
  part of our topics.</span> <span m='1388000'>Basically, all the curves we have seen
  in this class,</span> <span m='1391000'>there is a way to express the position of
  a point in terms of</span> <span m='1394000'>a parameter. We haven't seen any curves
  that</span> <span m='1403000'>are so complicated that you cannot do that.</span>
  <span m='1414000'>The other thing we have seen is that there are some special</span>
  <span m='1417000'>cases of vector fields where we don't actually have to compute</span>
  <span m='1420000'>this thing because maybe we know that it is the gradient of some</span>
  <span m='1423000'>potential function. And then we have a fundamental</span> <span
  m='1428000'>theorem that gives us a way to compute this without computing</span>
  <span m='1435000'>it. We've seen about gradient</span> <span m='1444000'>fields
  and path independence. The thing to check is whether</span> <span m='1456000'>the
  curl of our vector field is zero.</span> <span m='1458000'>And remember in the plane
  that is one condition,</span> <span m='1467000'>Nx equals My. In 3D in space that
  is actually</span> <span m='1473000'>three conditions because you have to check
  all the mixed</span> <span m='1479000'>partials of the various components.</span>
  <span m='1484000'>If the curl of f is zero that tells us we are likely to have a</span>
  <span m='1487000'>gradient field. Strictly-speaking,</span> <span m='1492000'>I
  should mention and F is defined in a simply-connected</span> <span m='1506000'>region.
  Then F is a gradient field.</span> <span m='1516000'>That means that we can find
  a potential function.</span> <span m='1525000'>You can write F as the gradient of
  little f for some potential</span> <span m='1530000'>function little f. And we have
  seen how to find</span> <span m='1539000'>the potential. In fact, we have seen two</span>
  <span m='1546000'>methods for that. And we have seen them twice.</span> <span m='1550000'>We
  have seen them once for functions of two variables,</span> <span m='1553000'>once
  for functions of three variables.</span> <span m='1555000'>They look very much the
  same. I encourage you to compare your</span> <span m='1558000'>notes for the two
  side by side to see where they differ.</span> <span m='1563000'>Where they differ,
  roughly-speaking,</span> <span m='1565000'>well, I never know if it is the first
  or the second,</span> <span m='1569000'>but one of the two methods was to compute
  a line integral.</span> <span m='1574000'>In the plane, what we did is we set up
  and</span> <span m='1578000'>evaluated a line integral along our favorite path from
  the</span> <span m='1583000'>origin to a point with coordinates say x1,</span> <span
  m='1587000'>y1. And then we had to evaluate the</span> <span m='1592000'>line integral
  for the work done along this path.</span> <span m='1598000'>And that will give us
  the value of potential at that point.</span> <span m='1603000'>If we are doing it
  with three variables, that method remains</span> <span m='1606000'>very similar.
  The only difference is now we</span> <span m='1609000'>have to go also up in space
  to some point x1,</span> <span m='1612000'>y1, z1. And so we actually sum three</span>
  <span m='1615000'>pieces together. But on each piece it is the</span> <span m='1619000'>same
  story, only one variable changes.</span> <span m='1621000'>Here it is only x that
  changes, it is only y that changes,</span> <span m='1626000'>and on the third one
  only z would be changing.</span> <span m='1631000'>That is one possibility. And
  the other possibility for</span> <span m='1638000'>finding the potential is that
  we start with the condition that</span> <span m='1643000'>the first component of
  our vector field should be equal to</span> <span m='1648000'>f sub x for the unknown
  potential function.</span> <span m='1652000'>What we do is integrate with respect
  to x,</span> <span m='1656000'>and we will get our potential function up to an integration</span>
  <span m='1660000'>constant. And that integration constant</span> <span m='1664000'>typically
  depends on the remaining variables that might</span> <span m='1668000'>be y or equal
  in space y and z. And then what we have to do is</span> <span m='1673000'>take the
  partial of this with respect to y and compare it to</span> <span m='1676000'>what
  we want it to be, namely the y component of a</span> <span m='1680000'>vector field,
  and match them to get some</span> <span m='1682000'>information about this guy.
  And if we have three variables</span> <span m='1688000'>then there is a third step
  because there you will still</span> <span m='1693000'>have an unknown function of
  z that you need to get by</span> <span m='1698000'>comparing the partials with respect
  to z.</span> <span m='1703000'>I see a lot of very quiet faces somehow.</span> <span
  m='1710000'>Well, hopefully that is because you know that stuff.</span> <span m='1716000'>If
  it is because you are hopelessly confused then please</span> <span m='1722000'>review
  a lot before the final, but I really hope that is not</span> <span m='1729000'>the
  case. And so,</span> <span m='1762000'>in particular, what we have seen is once
  we</span> <span m='1766000'>have the potential then we can use the fundamental theorem
  of</span> <span m='1772000'>calculus to tell us that if we have a line integral
  to compute</span> <span m='1778000'>for work along a curve that goes from some point
  P zero to some</span> <span m='1784000'>point P one then the line integral for the
  work done by</span> <span m='1789000'>gradient F is actually going just to be the
  change in value</span> <span m='1794000'>of a potential. And, in particular,</span>
  <span m='1798000'>that does not depend on how we got from P zero to P one.</span>
  <span m='1802000'>That is why we say that we have path independence.</span> <span
  m='1810000'>Next topic is flux in plane and space.</span> <span m='1822000'>Flux
  looks quite different in the plane and in space because,</span> <span m='1826000'>in
  the plane, it is just another kind of line</span> <span m='1829000'>integral, while
  in space it is a surface</span> <span m='1832000'>integral. If you were in four-dimensional</span>
  <span m='1834000'>space it would be a triple integral.</span> <span m='1835000'>Generally,
  you do flux for something that is somehow a wall</span> <span m='1843000'>that separates
  regions of space from each other.</span> <span m='1850000'>In the plane, the way
  we do it is we have a</span> <span m='1856000'>curve C and we look at its tangent
  vector,</span> <span m='1862000'>let's call that T, and we rotate it by 90 degrees</span>
  <span m='1869000'>clockwise. That is our convention to get a</span> <span m='1873000'>unit
  normal vector that points to the right of the curve as we</span> <span m='1878000'>move
  along the curve. That is our convention for</span> <span m='1881000'>orienting curves.
  And we are always going to be</span> <span m='1884000'>using that one. N equals
  T rotated 90 degrees</span> <span m='1893000'>clockwise. In particular,</span> <span
  m='1897000'>that means that n ds, which will be what we integrate</span> <span m='1904000'>against
  when we try to compute flux, will just end up being dy,</span> <span m='1912000'>negative
  dx. Concretely, when we have to</span> <span m='1918000'>evaluate a line integral
  of F dot n ds,</span> <span m='1923000'>geometrically we could try to take the dot
  product of our</span> <span m='1927000'>field with the normal vector and then sum
  the length element</span> <span m='1931000'>along the curve. And, in some cases,</span>
  <span m='1934000'>for example, if you know that the vector</span> <span m='1936000'>field
  is tangent to the curve or if a dot product is constant or</span> <span m='1939000'>things
  like that then that might actually give you a very easy</span> <span m='1942000'>answer.
  But, in general,</span> <span m='1944000'>the most efficient way to do it will be
  to say that if your</span> <span m='1948000'>vector field has components, I don't
  know,</span> <span m='1951000'>let's call them P and Q, then that will be just the
  line</span> <span m='1956000'>integral of PQ dot dy, negative dx,</span> <span m='1959000'>which
  means negative Q dx plus P dy.</span> <span m='1964000'>And, from that point onward,
  you evaluate it exactly the</span> <span m='1969000'>same way as you would for a
  work integral.</span> <span m='1974000'>But, of course, the geometric meaning is
  very</span> <span m='1976000'>different. It is the same meaning that we</span> <span
  m='1977000'>have always seen for flux. It measures how much a vector</span> <span
  m='1988000'>field goes across the curve. Now, if we are in space then</span> <span
  m='2002000'>you take flux for a surface, not for a curve.</span> <span m='2010000'>And
  the way it will work is that you have to choose an</span> <span m='2013000'>orientation
  of a surface, which just means choosing one</span> <span m='2017000'>of the two
  possible unit normal vectors.</span> <span m='2020000'>And then you will do a surface
  integral for F dot n dS.</span> <span m='2031000'>That is the surface i element.
  The setup for this surface</span> <span m='2040000'>integral is that first we have
  to express n and dS in some way.</span> <span m='2047000'>One possibility is that
  we can express the normal vector n dS</span> <span m='2054000'>geometrically. That
  is, for example,</span> <span m='2058000'>what we do when we look at, say, a horizontal
  plane or a</span> <span m='2063000'>vertical plane or a sphere or a cylinder.</span>
  <span m='2067000'>Then we have some geometric idea of why the normal vector is</span>
  <span m='2071000'>what it is and we have some formula for dS.</span> <span m='2074000'>Or,
  we can use one of the standard formulas.</span> <span m='2079000'>Basically, we
  have seen two formulas that work in fairly</span> <span m='2083000'>generate situations.
  One of them says -- If S is</span> <span m='2090000'>given by an equation z equals
  some function of x,</span> <span m='2100000'>y then you can just say n dS equals
  minus f sub x,</span> <span m='2106000'>minus f sub y, one, dx dy.</span> <span
  m='2109000'>And I need to rewrite that because I am running out of</span> <span
  m='2114000'>space. But, while I erase,</span> <span m='2116000'>I would like to
  point out the most important there in here.</span> <span m='2120000'>When I say
  n dS equals blah, blah, blah times dx dy,</span> <span m='2124000'>dx dy is not
  the same thing as dS at all.</span> <span m='2128000'>If you make that mistake you
  are going to get into trouble</span> <span m='2131000'>the next time that you try
  to buy real estate in a region</span> <span m='2134000'>which hills or cliffs or
  things like that.</span> <span m='2137000'>dS is the area on the slanted surface.</span>
  <span m='2140000'>dx dy is the area on the map that shows the x,</span> <span m='2146000'>y
  plane. And these are not the same</span> <span m='2149000'>thing. In particular,</span>
  <span m='2151000'>you cannot just take one piece of it and not the other piece.</span>
  <span m='2160000'>Let me give you formulas for n and for dS separately just to</span>
  <span m='2166000'>convince you. That way, if you feel that you</span> <span m='2174000'>need
  them, then you will have them.</span> <span m='2182000'>N is minus f sub x, minus
  f sub y,</span> <span m='2186000'>one, but scaled down to unit length.</span> <span
  m='2191000'>This is not a unit vector. It is actually divided by the</span> <span
  m='2195000'>length of this guy which is fx squared plus fy squared plus</span> <span
  m='2198000'>one. And dS is that same vector</span> <span m='2206000'>times dx dy.
  And so the square roots cancel</span> <span m='2212000'>out when you multiply them
  together.</span> <span m='2216000'>But it would be completely wrong to just say
  I will replace</span> <span m='2220000'>n dS by minus f sub x, minus f sub y and
  one.</span> <span m='2223000'>Then I end up again with the dS and I do something
  else with dS.</span> <span m='2227000'>That is a pretty bad conceptual mistake because
  it gives you the</span> <span m='2236000'>wrong answer. Another option more general</span>
  <span m='2240000'>than that. If we have not seen how to</span> <span m='2244000'>solve
  for z, how to express z as a function of x and y,</span> <span m='2252000'>well,
  maybe we still know some normal vector to the surface.</span> <span m='2260000'>Then
  there is another formula for n dS which is up to sine,</span> <span m='2269000'>N
  divided by N dot k dx dy. And, see, that projection</span> <span m='2275000'>formula
  works also if you have to project to another coordinate</span> <span m='2278000'>plane.
  For example,</span> <span m='2279000'>if you want to project to the x, z coordinate
  plane,</span> <span m='2282000'>the relation between n dS and dx dz is given by
  N over N dot</span> <span m='2290000'>j, because j is the direction</span> <span
  m='2293000'>perpendicular to the xz plane. But this one is more useful.</span> <span
  m='2299000'>What is a good example of that? If you have a slanted plane</span> <span
  m='2304000'>given to you, you can easily find its normal</span> <span m='2308000'>vector.
  That is just given by the</span> <span m='2311000'>coefficients of x, y, z in the
  equation.</span> <span m='2313000'>Another situation where that might happen is
  if your surface</span> <span m='2318000'>is given by an equation of a form of g
  of x,</span> <span m='2321000'>y, z equals zero. If that is the case then you</span>
  <span m='2324000'>know this is a level set of g. And we know how to find a</span>
  <span m='2327000'>normal vector to the level set, namely the gradient vector is</span>
  <span m='2330000'>always perpendicular to the level set.</span> <span m='2332000'>You
  would take the gradient of g to be your big N.</span> <span m='2339000'>OK. Now,
  these are basically all</span> <span m='2346000'>the integrals we have seen how
  to set up.</span> <span m='2350000'>Now we have a bunch of theorems relating them.</span>
  <span m='2355000'>Let me think about how I am going to organize that.</span> <span
  m='2363000'>Let me try like this. This part of the board will be</span> <span m='2372000'>work,
  this part of the board will be</span> <span m='2375000'>about flux and the left
  part of the board will be about things</span> <span m='2380000'>in the plane and
  the right one will be about things in space.</span> <span m='2386000'>What have
  we seen? Well, we have seen Green's</span> <span m='2393000'>theorem for work. That
  doesn't work so well</span> <span m='2397000'>because that is too small, so I am
  going to actually use</span> <span m='2399000'>more blackboards to do that.</span>
  <span m='2426000'>This side will be space, this side will be the plane and</span>
  <span m='2432000'>we are going to start with theorems about work.</span> <span m='2437000'>And
  we will see theorems about flux pretty soon.</span> <span m='2441000'>We have two
  theorems about work. In the plane that is called</span> <span m='2447000'>Green's
  theorem. In space that is called Stokes'</span> <span m='2451000'>theorem. Green's
  theorem says if I have</span> <span m='2456000'>a closed curve in the plane going
  counterclockwise enclosing</span> <span m='2463000'>entirely some region R then
  the line integral along C for the</span> <span m='2471000'>work of F is equal to
  the double integral of a region inside of</span> <span m='2480000'>the curl of F
  dA. Concretely, if my components of</span> <span m='2487000'>F are called M and
  N that is the line integral of M dx plus N dy</span> <span m='2495000'>is equal
  to the double integral of R of N sub x minus M sub y</span> <span m='2503000'>dA.
  This side here is a usual line</span> <span m='2506000'>integral. This side here
  is a usual</span> <span m='2509000'>double integral in the plane. And somehow their
  values end up</span> <span m='2513000'>being magically related. Well, not quite
  magically.</span> <span m='2518000'>We actually have seen how to prove it.</span>
  <span m='2523000'>And now the analog of that in space is Stokes' theorem.</span>
  <span m='2530000'>Stokes says if I have a closed curve in space,</span> <span m='2535000'>now
  I have to decide what kind of thing it bounds.</span> <span m='2540000'>And the
  answer is it will have to bound some surface,</span> <span m='2543000'>but I have
  a choice of surface. I choose my favorite surface</span> <span m='2548000'>bounded
  by C. I guess I will just draw it</span> <span m='2551000'>like that. And I have
  to choose a</span> <span m='2553000'>compatible orientation. Remember, we have seen
  this</span> <span m='2556000'>right hand rule for choosing how to orient the surface.</span>
  <span m='2559000'>I believe, in this case, if I take C like that then the</span>
  <span m='2563000'>normal vector has to go up. And then it tells me how to</span>
  <span m='2569000'>compute the work done by F along C.</span> <span m='2573000'>Namely,
  that becomes the double integral over that surface S of</span> <span m='2581000'>curl
  F, which I will write as dell cross F dot n dS.</span> <span m='2588000'>This line
  integral is a usual line integral,</span> <span m='2590000'>but if for some reason
  we don't want to compute it directly we</span> <span m='2594000'>can actually replace
  it by a surface integral over any</span> <span m='2598000'>surface bounded by the
  curve. It might be that a problem will</span> <span m='2602000'>tell you which surface
  you have to consider.</span> <span m='2603000'>It might be that you will be left
  to choose the simplest</span> <span m='2608000'>possible surface you can think of
  that is somehow having this</span> <span m='2613000'>curve as its boundary. And
  so now, remember,</span> <span m='2616000'>curl of a vector field in space is going
  to be another vector</span> <span m='2620000'>expression. It has three components.</span>
  <span m='2622000'>And the way you compute it is not by remembering the actual</span>
  <span m='2625000'>formula, which is really complicated by,</span> <span m='2628000'>but
  by instead computing the cross-product between dell and</span> <span m='2634000'>F.
  You set up the cross-product.</span> <span m='2641000'>And, of course, it is a highly
  symbolic</span> <span m='2643000'>cross-product. I mean it is not an</span> <span
  m='2647000'>cross-product of actual vectors but it works the same way.</span> <span
  m='2656000'>Both of these formulas basically relate work on a curve</span> <span
  m='2660000'>with what happens to the curl on the surface that is enclosed by</span>
  <span m='2664000'>this curve, that is bounded by this curve.</span> <span m='2667000'>And
  in this one you have less freedom of choice because you</span> <span m='2670000'>don't
  have somehow a z direction in which you could move your</span> <span m='2674000'>surface.
  There is only possible choice</span> <span m='2676000'>of surface. There is only
  one thing that is</span> <span m='2679000'>enclosed by this curve in the plane.</span>
  <span m='2682000'>In both cases, these things tell you that you</span> <span m='2685000'>can
  think of curl as measuring how much the field fails to be</span> <span m='2688000'>conservative.
  See, if your field was</span> <span m='2691000'>conservative -- If a curl was zero
  then the right-hand side</span> <span m='2695000'>would just be zero. And that would
  be fortunate</span> <span m='2697000'>because if a curl is zero then your field
  is less conservative.</span> <span m='2701000'>That means it comes from a potential.</span>
  <span m='2702000'>That means when you go along a closed curve,</span> <span m='2705000'>well,
  the change of value of a potential should be zero.</span> <span m='2709000'>Another
  way to say it is path independence tells you no work.</span> <span m='2713000'>And,
  of course, if you have a vector field that</span> <span m='2716000'>is not a gradient
  field then the curl is not necessarily zero and</span> <span m='2720000'>then you
  get a more interesting answer.</span> <span m='2723000'>Finally, let's move onto
  the theorems about flux.</span> <span m='2727000'>That is Green for flux and that
  is the divergence theorem.</span> <span m='2743000'>Flux theorems. Here I say that
  will be</span> <span m='2754000'>divergence. And here it will be Green again.</span>
  <span m='2761000'>Green's theorem for flux says I have a closed curve that goes</span>
  <span m='2767000'>counterclockwise around some region.</span> <span m='2770000'>In
  particular, counterclockwise means that the</span> <span m='2773000'>normal vector
  will be going out of the region.</span> <span m='2776000'>And then it tells us that
  the flux out of the region,</span> <span m='2780000'>through the curve C, so that
  will be the line</span> <span m='2784000'>integral of F dot n ds is equal to the
  integral of a region</span> <span m='2790000'>inside of div F dA. And remember the
  divergence of</span> <span m='2797000'>M, N is just Mx plus Ny. This one here,</span>
  <span m='2802000'>the divergence theorem, tells you something similar but</span>
  <span m='2806000'>now for a region of space bounded by a closed surface.</span>
  <span m='2809000'>So if you have some region of space and you call its boundary</span>
  <span m='2815000'>surface S and you let n be the normal vector that goes out of</span>
  <span m='2820000'>the region R. You orient S outwards.</span> <span m='2827000'>Then
  the flux out of the region through S is going to be the</span> <span m='2835000'>same
  as the triple integral over the region of divergence F dV.</span> <span m='2843000'>Remember,
  the divergence of a vector field with components P,</span> <span m='2851000'>Q,
  R is Px plus Qy plus Rz. What do these two theorems say?</span> <span m='2856000'>Well,
  they say essentially the same thing.</span> <span m='2859000'>They say the total
  flux out of a region is equal to the</span> <span m='2863000'>integral of divergence
  over whatever is inside.</span> <span m='2866000'>And the reason for that is, again,
  we have seen for a</span> <span m='2869000'>velocity field that divergence measures
  how much things are</span> <span m='2872000'>expanding or how much stuff is being
  created.</span> <span m='2875000'>It tells you the amount of sources per unit portion
  of the</span> <span m='2879000'>region. When you sum that over</span> <span m='2881000'>everything,
  you get the amount of fluid</span> <span m='2883000'>that is being, you know, the
  total amount of</span> <span m='2885000'>sources inside here, and that tells us
  how much</span> <span m='2888000'>stuff has to go out per unit time.</span> <span
  m='2890000'>That is basically the interpretation.</span> <span m='2892000'>In a
  way, I would be tempted to say that this table of four</span> <span m='2896000'>theorems
  is somehow the crucial point of 18.02.</span> <span m='2900000'>And you would do
  well to remember them.</span> <span m='2903000'>However, I would like also to point
  out that these theorems</span> <span m='2906000'>are completely useless if you don't
  know how to compute any of</span> <span m='2908000'>the integrals that are in there.
  So all the stuff that was</span> <span m='2911000'>around there before is actually
  somehow more fundamental.</span> <span m='2915000'>And if you don't know how to
  compute the double or triple</span> <span m='2918000'>integrals then this is of
  little use to you.</span> <span m='2921000'>That is the end. I guess I have to wish
  you</span> <span m='2928000'>happy holidays.</span> </p>
