  <span m='23000'>So, today we are going to continue looking at critical</span> <span
  m='28000'>points, and we'll learn how to actually</span> <span m='31000'>decide
  whether a typical point is a minimum,</span> <span m='33000'>maximum, or a saddle
  point. So, that's the main topic for</span> <span m='37000'>today. So, remember
  yesterday,</span> <span m='41000'>we looked at critical points of functions of several
  variables.</span> <span m='50000'>And, so a critical point functions, we have two
  values,</span> <span m='58000'>x and y. That's a point where the</span> <span m='65000'>partial
  derivatives are both zero.</span> <span m='71000'>And, we've seen that there's various
  kinds of critical</span> <span m='75000'>points. There's local minima.</span> <span
  m='80000'>So, maybe I should show the function on this contour</span> <span m='84000'>plot,there
  is local maxima, which are like that.</span> <span m='88000'>And, there's saddle
  points which are neither minima nor</span> <span m='95000'>maxima. And, of course,</span>
  <span m='97000'>if you have a real function, then it would be more</span> <span
  m='101000'>complicated. It will have several critical</span> <span m='105000'>points.
  So, this example here,</span> <span m='108000'>well, you see on the plot that there
  is two maxima.</span> <span m='114000'>And, there is in the middle, between them,</span>
  <span m='118000'>a saddle point. And, actually,</span> <span m='120000'>you can
  see them on the contour plot.</span> <span m='122000'>On the contour plot, you see
  the maxima because the</span> <span m='127000'>level curves become circles that
  now down and shrink to the</span> <span m='132000'>maximum. And, you can see the
  saddle</span> <span m='135000'>point because here you have this level curve that
  makes a figure</span> <span m='138000'>eight. It crosses itself.</span> <span m='140000'>And,
  if you move up or down here, so along the y direction,</span> <span m='145000'>the
  values of the function will decrease.</span> <span m='148000'>Along the x direction,
  the values will increase.</span> <span m='152000'>So, you can see usually quite
  easily where are the critical</span> <span m='157000'>points just by looking either
  at the graph or at the contour</span> <span m='162000'>plots. So, the only thing
  with the</span> <span m='164000'>contour plots is you need to read the values to
  tell a</span> <span m='167000'>minimum from a maximum because the contour plots
  look the same.</span> <span m='171000'>Just, of course, in one case,</span> <span
  m='173000'>the values increase, and in another one they</span> <span m='176000'>decrease.
  So, the question -- -- is,</span> <span m='183000'>how do we decide -- -- between
  the various possibilities?</span> <span m='197000'>So, local minimum, local maximum,</span>
  <span m='203000'>or saddle point.</span> <span m='218000'>So, and, in fact, why
  do we care?</span> <span m='224000'>Well, the other question is how do we find the
  global</span> <span m='235000'>minimum/maximum of a function? So, here what I should
  point</span> <span m='245000'>out, well, first of all,</span> <span m='247000'>to
  decide where the function is the largest,</span> <span m='249000'>in general you'll
  have actually to compare the values.</span> <span m='252000'>For example, here,
  if you want to know,</span> <span m='254000'>what is the maximum of this function?</span>
  <span m='256000'>Well, we have two obvious candidates.</span> <span m='259000'>We
  have this local maximum and that local maximum.</span> <span m='262000'>And, the
  question is, which one is the higher of the</span> <span m='264000'>two? Well, in
  this case,</span> <span m='266000'>actually, there is actually a tie for maximum.</span>
  <span m='270000'>But, in general, you would have to compute the</span> <span m='272000'>function
  at both points, and compare the values if you</span> <span m='274000'>know that
  it's three at one of them and four at the other.</span> <span m='276000'>Well, four
  wins. The other thing that you see</span> <span m='280000'>here is if you are looking
  for the minimum of this function,</span> <span m='283000'>well, the minimum is not
  going to be at any of the critical</span> <span m='287000'>points. So, where's the
  minimum?</span> <span m='289000'>Well, it looks like the minimum is actually out
  there on the</span> <span m='293000'>boundary or at infinity. So, that's another
  feature.</span> <span m='296000'>The global minimum or maximum doesn't have to be
  at a critical</span> <span m='299000'>point. It could also be,</span> <span m='301000'>somehow,
  on the side in some limiting situation where one</span> <span m='305000'>variable
  stops being in the allowed rang of values or goes</span> <span m='309000'>to infinity.
  So, we have to actually check</span> <span m='313000'>the boundary and the infinity
  behavior of our function to know</span> <span m='319000'>where, actually, the minimum
  and maximum will</span> <span m='323000'>be. So, in general,</span> <span m='327000'>I
  should point out, these should occur either at</span> <span m='337000'>the critical
  point or on the boundary or at infinity.</span> <span m='348000'>So, by that, I
  mean on the boundary of a</span> <span m='352000'>domain of definition that we are
  considering.</span> <span m='355000'>And so, we have to try both. OK, but so we'll
  get back to</span> <span m='360000'>that. For now, let's try to focus on</span>
  <span m='364000'>the question of, you know, what's the type of</span> <span m='369000'>the
  critical point? So, we'll use something that's</span> <span m='376000'>known as
  the second derivative test.</span> <span m='381000'>And, in principle, well, the
  idea is kind of</span> <span m='385000'>similar to what you do with the function
  of one variable,</span> <span m='389000'>namely, the function of one variable.</span>
  <span m='392000'>If the derivative is zero, then you know that you should</span>
  <span m='394000'>look at the second derivative. And, that will tell you whether</span>
  <span m='398000'>it's curving up or down whether you have a local max and the</span>
  <span m='401000'>local min. And, the main problem here is,</span> <span m='404000'>of
  course, we have more possible situations,</span> <span m='406000'>and we have several
  derivatives.</span> <span m='408000'>So, we have to think a bit harder about how
  we'll decide.</span> <span m='412000'>But, it will again involve the second derivative.</span>
  <span m='416000'>OK, so let's start with just an easy example that will be useful</span>
  <span m='421000'>to us because actually it will provide the basis for the</span>
  <span m='426000'>general method. OK, so we are first going to</span> <span m='430000'>consider
  a case where we have a function that's actually just</span> <span m='435000'>quadratic.
  So, let's say I have a</span> <span m='440000'>function, W of (x,y) that's of the
  form ax^2 bxy cy^2.</span> <span m='448000'>OK, so this guy has a critical point
  at the origin because if</span> <span m='452000'>you take the derivative with respect
  to x,</span> <span m='456000'>well, and if you plug x equals y equals zero,</span>
  <span m='458000'>you'll get zero, and same with respect to y.</span> <span m='462000'>You
  can also see, if you try to do a linear</span> <span m='464000'>approximation of
  this, well, all these guys are much</span> <span m='467000'>smaller than x and y
  when x and y are small.</span> <span m='470000'>So, the linear approximation, the
  tangent plane to the graph</span> <span m='475000'>is really just w=0. OK, so, how
  do we do it?</span> <span m='479000'>Well, yesterday we actually did an example.</span>
  <span m='483000'>It was a bit more complicated than that, but let me do it,</span>
  <span m='489000'>so remember, we were looking at something</span> <span m='493000'>that
  started with x^2 2xy 3y^2. And, there were other terms.</span> <span m='499000'>But,
  let's forget them now. And, what we did is we said,</span> <span m='503000'>well,
  we can rewrite this as (x y)^2 2y^2.</span> <span m='508000'>And now, this is a
  sum of two squares.</span> <span m='511000'>So, each of these guys has to be nonnegative.</span>
  <span m='515000'>And so, the origin will be a minimum.</span> <span m='520000'>Well,
  it turns out we can do something similar in general no</span> <span m='524000'>matter
  what the values of a, b, and c are.</span> <span m='527000'>We'll just try to first
  complete things to a square.</span> <span m='530000'>OK, so let's do that. So, in
  general,</span> <span m='535000'>well, let me be slightly less general, and let
  me assume that</span> <span m='541000'>a is not zero because otherwise I can't do
  what I'm going to do.</span> <span m='548000'>So, I'm going to write this as a times
  x^2 plus b over axy.</span> <span m='560000'>And then I have my cy^2. And now this
  looks like the</span> <span m='565000'>beginning of the square of something, OK,</span>
  <span m='568000'>just like what we did over there.</span> <span m='571000'>So, what
  is it the square of? Well, you'd start with x plus I</span> <span m='579000'>claim
  if I put b over 2a times y and I square it,</span> <span m='585000'>then see the
  cross term two times x times b over 2a y will</span> <span m='592000'>become b over
  axy. Of course, now I also get some</span> <span m='597000'>y squares out of this.
  How many y squares do I get?</span> <span m='601000'>Well, I get b^2 over 4a^2 times
  a.</span> <span m='605000'>So, I get b2 over 4a y^2. So, and I want,</span> <span
  m='611000'>in fact, c times y^2. So, the number of y^2 that I</span> <span m='617000'>should
  add is c minus b^2 over 4a.</span> <span m='622000'>OK, let's see that again. If
  I expand this thing,</span> <span m='627000'>I will get ax^2 plus a times b over
  2a times 2xy.</span> <span m='633000'>That's going to be my bxy. But, I also get
  b^2 over 4a^2</span> <span m='639000'>y^2 times a. That's b^2 over 4ay^2.</span>
  <span m='644000'>And, that cancels out with this guy here.</span> <span m='647000'>And
  then, I will be left with cy^2.</span> <span m='652000'>OK, do you see it kind of?
  OK, if not, well,</span> <span m='658000'>try expanding this square again.</span>
  <span m='664000'>OK, maybe I'll do it just to convince you.</span> <span m='666000'>But,
  so if I expand this, I will get A times,</span> <span m='671000'>let me put that
  in a different color because you shouldn't</span> <span m='676000'>write that down.
  It's just to convince you again.</span> <span m='679000'>So, if you don't see it
  yet, let's expend this thing.</span> <span m='685000'>We'll get a times x^2 plus
  a times 2xb over 2ay.</span> <span m='695000'>Well, the two A's cancel out. We get
  bxy plus a times the</span> <span m='702000'>square of that's going to be b^2 over
  4a^2 y^2 plus cy^2 minus</span> <span m='713000'>b^2 over 4ay^2. Here, the a and
  the a</span> <span m='719000'>simplifies, and now these two terms simplify and give
  me just</span> <span m='726000'>cy^2 in the end. OK, and that's kind of</span> <span
  m='729000'>unreadable after I've canceled everything,</span> <span m='732000'>but
  if you follow it, you see that basically I've</span> <span m='739000'>just rewritten
  my initial function.</span> <span m='744000'>OK, is that kind of OK? I mean, otherwise
  there's just</span> <span m='749000'>no substitute. You'll have to do it yourself,</span>
  <span m='752000'>I'm afraid. OK, so, let me continue to play</span> <span m='758000'>with
  this. So, I'm just going to put this</span> <span m='763000'>in a slightly different
  form just to clear the denominators.</span> <span m='768000'>OK, so, I will instead
  write this as one over 4a times the</span> <span m='776000'>big thing. So, I'm going
  to just put 4a^2</span> <span m='783000'>times x plus b over 2ay squared. OK, so
  far I have the same</span> <span m='790000'>thing as here. I just introduced the
  4a that</span> <span m='793000'>cancels out, plus for the other one, I'm just clearing
  the</span> <span m='799000'>denominator. I end up with (4ac-b^2)y^2.</span> <span
  m='808000'>OK, so that's a lot of terms. But, what does it look like?</span> <span
  m='812000'>Well, it looks like, so we have some constant</span> <span m='815000'>factors,
  and here we have a square, and here we have a</span> <span m='818000'>square. So,
  basically,</span> <span m='819000'>we've written this as a sum of two squares, well,</span>
  <span m='824000'>a sum or a difference of two squares.</span> <span m='827000'>And,
  maybe that's what we need to figure out to know what kind</span> <span m='831000'>of
  point it is because, see, if you take a sum of two</span> <span m='835000'>squares,
  that you will know that each</span> <span m='837000'>square takes nonnegative values.
  And you will have,</span> <span m='841000'>the function will always take nonnegative
  values.</span> <span m='844000'>So, the origin will be a minimum.</span> <span m='847000'>Well,
  if you have a difference of two squares that typically</span> <span m='850000'>you'll
  have a saddle point because depending on whether one</span> <span m='853000'>or
  the other is larger, you will have a positive or a</span> <span m='858000'>negative
  quantity. OK, so I claim there's various</span> <span m='864000'>cases to look at.
  So, let's see.</span> <span m='872000'>So, in fact, I claim there will be three</span>
  <span m='874000'>cases. And, that's good news for us</span> <span m='877000'>because
  after all, we want to distinguish between</span> <span m='880000'>three possibilities.
  So, let's first do away with</span> <span m='885000'>the most complicated one. What
  if 4ac minus b^2 is</span> <span m='892000'>negative? Well, if it's negative,</span>
  <span m='896000'>then it means what I have between the brackets is,</span> <span
  m='900000'>so the first guy is obviously a positive quantity,</span> <span m='906000'>while
  the second one will be something negative times y2.</span> <span m='910000'>So,
  it will be a negative quantity.</span> <span m='913000'>OK, so one term is positive.
  The other is negative.</span> <span m='923000'>That tells us we actually have a
  saddle point.</span> <span m='931000'>We have, in fact, written our function as
  a</span> <span m='935000'>difference of two squares. OK, is that convincing?</span>
  <span m='940000'>So, if you want, what I could do is actually I</span> <span m='942000'>could
  change my coordinates, have new coordinates called u</span> <span m='947000'>equals
  x b over 2ay, and v, actually,</span> <span m='950000'>well, I could keep y, and
  that it would look like the</span> <span m='955000'>difference of squares directly.
  OK, so that's the first case.</span> <span m='962000'>The second case is where 4ac-b^2
  = 0.</span> <span m='972000'>Well, what happens if that's zero?</span> <span m='978000'>Then
  it means that this term over there goes away.</span> <span m='981000'>So, what we
  have is just one square.</span> <span m='985000'>OK, so what that means is actually
  that our function</span> <span m='989000'>depends only on one direction of things.</span>
  <span m='992000'>In the other direction, it's going to actually be</span> <span
  m='996000'>degenerate. So, for example,</span> <span m='998000'>forget all the clutter
  in there.</span> <span m='1000000'>Say I give you just the function of two variables,</span>
  <span m='1005000'>w equals just x^2. So, that means it doesn't</span> <span m='1009000'>depend
  on y at all. And, if I try to plot the</span> <span m='1013000'>graph, it will look
  like, well, x is here.</span> <span m='1018000'>So, it will depend on x in that
  way, but it doesn't depend on y</span> <span m='1024000'>at all. So, what the graph
  looks like</span> <span m='1030000'>is something like that. OK, basically it's a
  valley</span> <span m='1038000'>whose bottom is completely flat. So, that means,</span>
  <span m='1042000'>actually, we have a degenerate critical point.</span> <span m='1044000'>It's
  called degenerate because there is a direction in which</span> <span m='1048000'>nothing
  happens. And, in fact,</span> <span m='1050000'>you have critical points everywhere
  along the y axis.</span> <span m='1058000'>Now, whether the square that we have
  is x or something else,</span> <span m='1062000'>namely, x plus b over 2a y, it
  doesn't matter.</span> <span m='1066000'>I mean, it will still get this degenerate
  behavior.</span> <span m='1068000'>But there's a direction in which nothing happens
  because we</span> <span m='1076000'>just have the square of one quantity.</span>
  <span m='1082000'>I'm sure that 300 students means 300 different ring tones,</span>
  <span m='1086000'>but I'm not eager to hear all of them, thanks.</span> <span m='1089000'>[LAUGHTER]
  OK, so, this is what's called a</span> <span m='1098000'>degenerate critical point,
  and [LAUGHTER].</span> <span m='1108000'>OK, so basically we'll leave it here.</span>
  <span m='1113000'>We won't actually try to figure out further what happens,</span>
  <span m='1118000'>and the reason for that is that when you have an actual</span>
  <span m='1122000'>function, a general function,</span> <span m='1124000'>not just
  one that's quadratic like this,</span> <span m='1126000'>then there will actually
  be other terms maybe involving</span> <span m='1130000'>higher powers, maybe x^3
  or y^3 or things like</span> <span m='1134000'>that. And then, they will mess up</span>
  <span m='1136000'>what happens in this valley. And, it's a situation where we</span>
  <span m='1140000'>won't be able, actually, to tell automatically</span> <span m='1143000'>just
  by looking at second derivatives what happens.</span> <span m='1146000'>See, for
  example, in a function of one variable,</span> <span m='1149000'>if you have just
  a function of one variable,</span> <span m='1152000'>say, f of x equals x to the
  five,</span> <span m='1154000'>well, if you try to decide what type of point the
  origin is,</span> <span m='1158000'>you're going to take the second derivative.</span>
  <span m='1160000'>It will be zero, and then you can conclude.</span> <span m='1163000'>Those
  things depend on higher order derivatives.</span> <span m='1166000'>So, we just
  won't like that case.</span> <span m='1169000'>We just won't try to figure out what's
  going on here.</span> <span m='1174000'>Now, the last situation is if 4ac-b^2 is
  positive.</span> <span m='1180000'>So, then, that means that actually we've written
  things.</span> <span m='1185000'>The big bracket up there is a sum of two squares.</span>
  <span m='1192000'>So, that means that we've written w as one over 4a times</span>
  <span m='1200000'>plus something squared plus something else squared,</span> <span
  m='1208000'>OK? So, these guys have the same</span> <span m='1212000'>sign, and
  that means that this term here will always be greater</span> <span m='1218000'>than
  or equal to zero. And that means that we should</span> <span m='1222000'>either
  have a maximum or minimum.</span> <span m='1224000'>How we find out which one it
  is? Well, we look at the sign of a,</span> <span m='1229000'>exactly. OK?</span>
  <span m='1230000'>So, there's two sub-cases. One is if a is positive,</span> <span
  m='1235000'>then, this quantity overall will always be nonnegative.</span> <span
  m='1240000'>And that means we have a minimum, OK?</span> <span m='1254000'>And,
  if a is negative on the other hand,</span> <span m='1258000'>so that means that
  we multiply this positive quantity by a</span> <span m='1261000'>negative number,
  we get something that's always</span> <span m='1264000'>negative. So, zero is actually
  the</span> <span m='1270000'>maximum. OK, is that clear for everyone?</span> <span
  m='1278000'>Yes? Sorry, yeah,</span> <span m='1289000'>so I said in the example
  w equals x^2, it doesn't depend on</span> <span m='1294000'>y. So, the more general
  situation</span> <span m='1297000'>is w equals some constant. Well, I guess it's
  a times (x b</span> <span m='1304000'>over 2a times y)^2. So, it does depend on
  x and y,</span> <span m='1308000'>but it only depends on this combination.</span>
  <span m='1311000'>OK, so if I choose to move in some other perpendicular</span>
  <span m='1314000'>direction, in the direction where this</span> <span m='1318000'>remains
  constant, so maybe if I set x equals</span> <span m='1322000'>minus b over 2a y,
  then this remains zero all the</span> <span m='1326000'>time. So, there's a degenerate</span>
  <span m='1328000'>direction in which I stay at the minimum or maximum,</span> <span
  m='1331000'>or whatever it is that I have. OK, so that's why it's called</span>
  <span m='1335000'>degenerate. There is a direction in which</span> <span m='1337000'>nothing
  happens. OK, yes?</span> <span m='1349000'>Yes, yeah, so that's a very good question.</span>
  <span m='1351000'>So, there's going to be the second derivative test.</span> <span
  m='1353000'>Why do not have derivatives yet? Well, that's because I've been</span>
  <span m='1356000'>looking at this special example where we have a function like</span>
  <span m='1359000'>this. And, so I don't actually need</span> <span m='1361000'>to
  take derivatives yet. But, secretly,</span> <span m='1363000'>that's because a,
  b, and c will be the second</span> <span m='1366000'>derivatives of the function,
  actually, 2a,</span> <span m='1369000'>b, and 2c. So now, we are going to go to</span>
  <span m='1372000'>general function. And there, instead of having</span> <span m='1374000'>these
  coefficients a, b, and c given to us,</span> <span m='1377000'>we'll have to compute
  them as second derivatives.</span> <span m='1380000'>OK, so here, I'm basically
  setting the stage</span> <span m='1383000'>for what will be the actual criterion
  we'll use using second</span> <span m='1387000'>derivatives. Yes?</span> <span m='1393000'>So,
  yeah, so what you have a degenerate critical point,</span> <span m='1396000'>it
  could be a degenerate minimum, or a degenerate maximum</span> <span m='1400000'>depending
  on the sign of a. But, in general,</span> <span m='1403000'>once you start having
  functions, you don't really know</span> <span m='1406000'>what will happen anymore.
  It could also be a degenerate</span> <span m='1410000'>saddle, and so on. So, we
  won't really be able to</span> <span m='1416000'>tell. Yes?</span> <span m='1420000'>It
  is possible to have a degenerate saddle point.</span> <span m='1423000'>For example,
  if I gave you x^3 y^3,</span> <span m='1426000'>you can convince yourself that if
  you take x and y to be</span> <span m='1429000'>negative, it will be negative. If
  x and y are positive,</span> <span m='1433000'>it's positive. And, it has a very
  degenerate</span> <span m='1435000'>critical point at the origin. So, that's a degenerate
  saddle</span> <span m='1439000'>point. We don't see it here because</span> <span
  m='1441000'>that doesn't happen if you have only quadratic terms like that.</span>
  <span m='1444000'>You need to have higher-order terms to see it happen.</span> <span
  m='1452000'>OK. OK, so let's continue.</span> <span m='1463000'>Before we continue,
  but see, I wanted to point out</span> <span m='1467000'>one small thing. So, here,
  we have the magic</span> <span m='1470000'>quantity, 4ac minus b^2. You've probably
  seen that</span> <span m='1474000'>before in your life. Yet, it looks like the</span>
  <span m='1477000'>quadratic formula, except that one involves</span> <span m='1480000'>b^2-4ac.
  But that's really the same</span> <span m='1483000'>thing. OK, so let's see,</span>
  <span m='1487000'>where does the quadratic formula come in here?</span> <span m='1497000'>Well,
  let me write things differently.</span> <span m='1500000'>OK, so we've manipulated
  things, and got into a</span> <span m='1503000'>conclusion. But, let me just do
  a different</span> <span m='1508000'>manipulation, and write this now instead as</span>
  <span m='1514000'>y^2 times a times x over y squared plus b(x over y) plus c.</span>
  <span m='1523000'>OK, see, that's the same thing that I had before.</span> <span
  m='1528000'>Well, so now this quantity here is always nonnegative.</span> <span
  m='1535000'>What about this one? Well, of course,</span> <span m='1539000'>this
  one depends on x over y. It means it depends on which</span> <span m='1543000'>direction
  you're going to move away from the origin,</span> <span m='1545000'>which ratio
  between x and y you will consider.</span> <span m='1548000'>But, I claim there's
  two situations.</span> <span m='1551000'>One is, so, let's try to reformulate things.</span>
  <span m='1557000'>So, if a discriminate here is positive, then it means that</span>
  <span m='1564000'>these have roots and these have solutions.</span> <span m='1570000'>And,
  that means that this quantity can be both positive</span> <span m='1579000'>and
  negative. This quantity takes positive</span> <span m='1584000'>and negative values.
  One way to convince yourself is</span> <span m='1591000'>just to, you know, plot
  at^2 bt c.</span> <span m='1597000'>You know that there's two roots. So, it might
  look like this,</span> <span m='1603000'>or might look like that depending on the
  sign of a.</span> <span m='1608000'>But, in either case, it will take values of
  both</span> <span m='1612000'>signs. So, that means that your</span> <span m='1614000'>function
  will take values of both signs.</span> <span m='1624000'>The value takes both positive
  and negative values.</span> <span m='1633000'>And, so that means we have a saddle
  point,</span> <span m='1641000'>while the other situation, when b^2-4ac is negative
  -- --</span> <span m='1648000'>means that this equation is quadratic never takes
  the value,</span> <span m='1656000'>zero. So, it's always positive or</span> <span
  m='1659000'>it's always negative, depending on the sign of a.</span> <span m='1662000'>So,
  the other case is if b^2-4ac is negative,</span> <span m='1668000'>then the quadratic
  doesn't have a solution.</span> <span m='1673000'>And it could look like this or
  like that depending on whether a</span> <span m='1678000'>is positive or a is negative.
  So, in particular,</span> <span m='1683000'>that means that ax over y2 plus bx over
  y plus c is always</span> <span m='1692000'>positive or always negative depending
  on the sign of a.</span> <span m='1701000'>And then, that tells us that our function,</span>
  <span m='1703000'>w, will be always positive or always negative.</span> <span m='1705000'>And
  then we'll get a minimum or maximum.</span> <span m='1720000'>OK, we'll have a min
  or a max depending on which situation we</span> <span m='1724000'>are in. OK, so
  that's another way to</span> <span m='1727000'>derive the same answer. And now,
  you see here why the</span> <span m='1731000'>discriminate plays a role. That's
  because it exactly tells</span> <span m='1735000'>you whether this quadratic quantity
  has always the same</span> <span m='1739000'>sign, or whether it can actually</span>
  <span m='1744000'>cross the value, zero, when you have the root of</span> <span
  m='1752000'>a quadratic. OK, so hopefully at this stage</span> <span m='1756000'>you
  are happy with one of the two explanations,</span> <span m='1760000'>at least. And
  now, you are willing to</span> <span m='1763000'>believe, I hope, that we have basically
  a way of</span> <span m='1766000'>deciding what type of critical point we have in
  the special</span> <span m='1770000'>case of a quadratic function.</span> <span
  m='1798000'>OK, so, now what do we do with the general function?</span> <span m='1805000'>Well,
  so in general, we want to look at second</span> <span m='1819000'>derivatives. OK,
  so now we are getting to</span> <span m='1824000'>the real stuff. So, how many second
  derivatives</span> <span m='1827000'>do we have? That's maybe the first thing we</span>
  <span m='1829000'>should figure out. Well, we can take the</span> <span m='1832000'>derivative
  first with respect to x, and then again with respect</span> <span m='1839000'>to
  x. OK, that gives us something we</span> <span m='1844000'>denote by partial square
  f over partial x squared or fxx.</span> <span m='1854000'>Then, there's another
  one which is fxy, which means you take the</span> <span m='1860000'>derivative with
  respect to x, and then with respect to y.</span> <span m='1865000'>Another thing
  you can do, is do first derivative respect</span> <span m='1869000'>to y, and then
  with respect to x.</span> <span m='1872000'>That would be fyx. Well, good news.</span>
  <span m='1877000'>These are actually always equal to each other.</span> <span m='1882000'>OK,
  so it's the fact that we will admit, it's actually not</span> <span m='1886000'>very
  hard to check. So these are always the same.</span> <span m='1890000'>We don't need
  to worry about which one we do.</span> <span m='1893000'>That's one computation
  that we won't need to do.</span> <span m='1896000'>We can save a bit of effort.
  And then, we have the last one,</span> <span m='1903000'>namely, the second partial
  with respect to y and y fyy.</span> <span m='1911000'>OK, so we have three of them.
  So, what does the second</span> <span m='1920000'>derivative test say?</span> <span
  m='1936000'>It says, say that you have a critical point (x0,</span> <span m='1942000'>y0)
  of a function of two variables, f,</span> <span m='1947000'>and then let's compute
  the partial derivatives.</span> <span m='1954000'>So, let's call capital A the second
  derivative with respect</span> <span m='1961000'>to x. Let's call capital B the
  second</span> <span m='1965000'>derivative with respect to x and y.</span> <span
  m='1969000'>And C equals fyy at this point, OK?</span> <span m='1975000'>So, these
  are just numbers because we first compute the</span> <span m='1979000'>second derivative,
  and then we plug in the values</span> <span m='1982000'>of x and y at the critical
  point.</span> <span m='1984000'>So, these will just be numbers. And now, what we
  do is we look</span> <span m='1994000'>at the quantity AC-B^2. I am not forgetting
  the four.</span> <span m='2001000'>You will see why there isn't one.</span> <span
  m='2006000'>So, if AC-B^2 is positive, then there's two sub-cases.</span> <span
  m='2011000'>If A is positive, then it's local minimum.</span> <span m='2030000'>The
  second case, so, still, if AC-B^2 is</span> <span m='2036000'>positive, but A is
  negative, then it's going to be a local</span> <span m='2044000'>maximum. And, if
  AC-B^2 is negative,</span> <span m='2051000'>then it's a saddle point, and finally,</span>
  <span m='2057000'>if AC-B^2 is zero, then we actually cannot</span> <span m='2064000'>compute.
  We don't know whether it's</span> <span m='2068000'>going to be a minimum, a maximum,
  or a saddle.</span> <span m='2073000'>We know it's degenerate in some way, but we
  don't know what type</span> <span m='2077000'>of point it is. OK, so that's actually
  what you</span> <span m='2080000'>need to remember. If you are formula oriented,</span>
  <span m='2083000'>that's all you need to remember about today.</span> <span m='2085000'>But,
  let's try to understand why, how this comes out of what</span> <span m='2093000'>we
  had there. OK, so, I think maybe I</span> <span m='2099000'>actually want to keep,
  so maybe I want to keep this</span> <span m='2105000'>middle board because it actually
  has,</span> <span m='2106000'>you know, the recipe that we found before the quadratic</span>
  <span m='2109000'>function. So, let me move directly over</span> <span m='2112000'>there
  and try to relate our old recipe with the new.</span> <span m='2143000'>OK, you
  are easily amused. OK, so first,</span> <span m='2150000'>let's check that these
  two things say the same thing in the</span> <span m='2157000'>special case that
  we are looking at.</span> <span m='2161000'>OK, so let's verify in the special case
  where the function</span> <span m='2172000'>was ax^2 bxy cy^2. So -- Well, what
  is the second</span> <span m='2182000'>derivative with respect to x and x?</span>
  <span m='2188000'>If I take the second derivative with respect to x and x,</span>
  <span m='2191000'>so first I want to take maybe the derivative with respect to</span>
  <span m='2194000'>x. But first, let's take the first</span> <span m='2197000'>partial,
  Wx. That will be 2ax by, right?</span> <span m='2206000'>So, Wxx will be, well,
  let's take a partial with</span> <span m='2210000'>respect to x again. That's 2a.</span>
  <span m='2214000'>Wxy, I take the partial respect to y, and we'll get b.</span>
  <span m='2222000'>OK, now we need, also, the partial with respect</span> <span m='2226000'>to
  y. So, Wy is bx 2cy.</span> <span m='2233000'>In case you don't believe what I told
  you about the mixed</span> <span m='2237000'>partials, Wyx, well, you can check.</span>
  <span m='2241000'>And it's, again, b. So, they are,</span> <span m='2244000'>indeed,
  the same thing. And, Wyy will be 2c.</span> <span m='2250000'>So, if we now look
  at these quantities, that tells us,</span> <span m='2259000'>well, big A is two
  little a, big B is little b,</span> <span m='2266000'>big C is two little c. So,
  AC-B^2 is what we used to</span> <span m='2275000'>call four little ac minus b2.
  OK, ooh.</span> <span m='2284000'>[LAUGHTER] So, now you can compare the</span>
  <span m='2287000'>cases. They are not listed in the same</span> <span m='2290000'>order
  just to make it harder. So, we said first,</span> <span m='2294000'>so the saddle
  case is when AC-B^2 in big letters is</span> <span m='2300000'>negative, that's
  the same as 4ac-b2 in lower case is</span> <span m='2306000'>negative. The case
  where capital AC-B2 is</span> <span m='2310000'>positive, local min and local max
  corresponds to this one.</span> <span m='2315000'>And, the case where we can't conclude
  was what used to be the</span> <span m='2320000'>degenerate one. OK, so at least
  we don't seem</span> <span m='2324000'>to have messed up when copying the formula.</span>
  <span m='2328000'>Now, why does that work more generally than that?</span> <span
  m='2336000'>Well, the answer that is, again, Taylor approximation.</span> <span
  m='2343000'>Aww. OK, so let me just do here</span> <span m='2356000'>quadratic approximation.
  So, quadratic approximation</span> <span m='2362000'>tells me the following thing.
  It tells me,</span> <span m='2365000'>if I have a function, f of xy, and I want
  to</span> <span m='2370000'>understand the change in f when I change x and y a little
  bit.</span> <span m='2377000'>Well, there's the first-order terms.</span> <span
  m='2380000'>There is the linear terms that by now you should know and be</span>
  <span m='2383000'>comfortable with. That's fx times the change in x.</span> <span
  m='2391000'>And then, there's fy times the change in y.</span> <span m='2396000'>OK,
  that's the starting point. But now, of course,</span> <span m='2400000'>if x and
  y, sorry, if we are at the critical</span> <span m='2403000'>point, then that's
  going to be zero at the critical point.</span> <span m='2409000'>So, that term actually
  goes away, and that's also zero at</span> <span m='2416000'>the critical point.
  So, that term also goes away.</span> <span m='2422000'>OK, so linear approximation
  is really no good.</span> <span m='2424000'>We need more terms. So, what are the
  next terms?</span> <span m='2427000'>Well, the next terms are quadratic terms,</span>
  <span m='2435000'>and so I mean, if you remember the Taylor</span> <span m='2438000'>formula
  for a function of a single variable,</span> <span m='2442000'>there was the derivative
  times x minus x0 plus one half of a</span> <span m='2446000'>second derivative times
  x-x0^2. And see, this side here is</span> <span m='2451000'>really Taylor approximation
  in one variable looking only at x.</span> <span m='2455000'>But of course, we also
  have terms involving y,</span> <span m='2457000'>and terms involving simultaneously
  x and y.</span> <span m='2460000'>And, these terms are fxy times change in x times
  change in y</span> <span m='2470000'>plus one half of fyy(y-y0)^2. There's no one
  half in the</span> <span m='2477000'>middle because, in fact, you would have two</span>
  <span m='2480000'>terms, one for xy, one for yx, but they are the</span> <span m='2484000'>same.
  And then, if you want to</span> <span m='2486000'>continue, there is actually cubic
  terms involving the third</span> <span m='2489000'>derivatives, and so on, but we
  are not actually looking</span> <span m='2492000'>at them. And so, now,</span> <span
  m='2494000'>when we do this approximation, well, the type of critical</span> <span
  m='2499000'>point remains the same when we replace the function by this</span> <span
  m='2505000'>approximation. And so, we can apply the</span> <span m='2508000'>argument
  that we used to deduce things in the quadratic case.</span> <span m='2513000'>In
  fact, it still works in the general case using this</span> <span m='2515000'>approximation
  formula.</span> <span m='2532000'>So -- The general case reduces to the quadratic
  case.</span> <span m='2546000'>And now, you see actually why, well, here you see,</span>
  <span m='2551000'>again, how this coefficient which we used to call little a</span>
  <span m='2556000'>is also one half of capital A. And same here:</span> <span m='2561000'>this
  coefficient is what we call capital B or little b,</span> <span m='2567000'>and
  this coefficient here is what we called little c or one</span> <span m='2572000'>half
  of capital C. And then, when you replace</span> <span m='2577000'>these into the
  various cases that we had here,</span> <span m='2582000'>you end up with the second
  derivative test.</span> <span m='2586000'>So, what about the degenerate case?</span>
  <span m='2588000'>Why can't we just say, well, it's going to be a</span> <span m='2591000'>degenerate
  critical point? So, the reason is that this</span> <span m='2596000'>approximation
  formula is reasonable only if the higher</span> <span m='2600000'>order terms are
  negligible. OK, so in fact,</span> <span m='2604000'>secretly, there's more terms.
  This is only an approximation.</span> <span m='2607000'>There would be terms involving
  third derivatives,</span> <span m='2610000'>and maybe even beyond that. And, so
  it is not to generate</span> <span m='2614000'>case, they don't actually matter</span>
  <span m='2617000'>because the shape of the function,</span> <span m='2619000'>the
  shape of the graph, is actually determined by the</span> <span m='2622000'>quadratic
  terms. But, in the degenerate case,</span> <span m='2625000'>see, if I start with
  this and I add something even very,</span> <span m='2629000'>very small along the
  y axis, then that can be enough to bend</span> <span m='2633000'>this very slightly
  up or slightly down,</span> <span m='2636000'>and turn my degenerate point in to
  either a minimum or a saddle</span> <span m='2640000'>point. And, I won't be able
  to tell</span> <span m='2643000'>until I go further in the list of derivatives.</span>
  <span m='2646000'>So, in the degenerate case, what actually happens depends</span>
  <span m='2654000'>on the higher order derivatives.</span> <span m='2678000'>So,
  we will need to analyze things more carefully.</span> <span m='2682000'>Well, we're
  not going to bother with that in this class.</span> <span m='2685000'>So, we'll
  just say, well, we cannot compute,</span> <span m='2692000'>OK? I mean, you have
  to realize</span> <span m='2694000'>that in real life, you have to be extremely</span>
  <span m='2697000'>unlucky for this quantity to end up being exactly 0.</span> <span
  m='2702000'>[LAUGHTER] Well, if that happens,</span> <span m='2703000'>then what
  you should do is maybe try by inspection.</span> <span m='2705000'>See if there's
  a good reason why the function should always</span> <span m='2708000'>be positive
  or always be negative, or something.</span> <span m='2711000'>Or, you know, plot
  it on a computer and see</span> <span m='2716000'>what happens. But, otherwise we
  can't compute.</span> <span m='2723000'>OK, so let's do an example. So, probably
  I should leave</span> <span m='2733000'>this on so that we still have the test with
  us.</span> <span m='2739000'>And, instead, OK, so I'll do my example here.</span>
  <span m='2780000'>OK, so just an example. Let's look at f of (x,</span> <span m='2790000'>y)
  = x y 1/xy, where x and y are positive.</span> <span m='2797000'>So, I'm looking
  only at the first quadrant.</span> <span m='2799000'>OK, I mean, I'm doing this
  because I don't want the</span> <span m='2802000'>denominator to become zero. So,
  I'm just looking at the</span> <span m='2806000'>situation. So, let's look first
  for,</span> <span m='2810000'>so, the question will be, what are the minimum and</span>
  <span m='2815000'>maximum of this function? So, the first thing we should</span>
  <span m='2823000'>do to answer this question is look for critical points,</span>
  <span m='2832000'>OK? So, for that,</span> <span m='2835000'>we have to compute
  the first derivatives.</span> <span m='2839000'>OK, so fx is one minus one over
  x^2y, OK?</span> <span m='2854000'>Take the derivative of one over x, that's negative
  one over x^2.</span> <span m='2859000'>And, we'll want to set that equal to zero.</span>
  <span m='2864000'>And fy is one minus one over xy^2.</span> <span m='2870000'>And,
  we want to set that equal to zero.</span> <span m='2874000'>So, what are the equations
  we have to solve?</span> <span m='2879000'>Well, I guess x^2y equals one, I mean,
  if I move this guy over</span> <span m='2885000'>here I get one over x^2y equals
  one.</span> <span m='2889000'>That's x^2y equals one, and xy^2 equals one.</span>
  <span m='2894000'>What do you get by comparing these two?</span> <span m='2898000'>Well,
  x and y should both be, OK, so yeah,</span> <span m='2901000'>I agree with you that
  one and one is a solution.</span> <span m='2904000'>Why is it the only one? So,
  first, if I divide this one</span> <span m='2907000'>by that one, I get x over y
  equals one.</span> <span m='2909000'>So, it tells me x equals y. And then, if x
  equals y,</span> <span m='2914000'>then if I put that into here, it will give me
  y^3 equals one,</span> <span m='2920000'>which tells me y equals one, and therefore,</span>
  <span m='2924000'>x equals one as well. OK, so, there's only one</span> <span m='2930000'>solution.
  There's only one critical</span> <span m='2934000'>point, which is going to be (1,1).</span>
  <span m='2938000'>OK, so, now here's where you do a bit of work.</span> <span m='2949000'>What
  do you think of that critical point?</span> <span m='2958000'>OK, I see some valid
  votes. I see some, OK,</span> <span m='2965000'>I see a lot of people answering
  four.</span> <span m='2968000'>[LAUGHTER] that seems to suggest that</span> <span
  m='2970000'>maybe you haven't completed the second derivative yet.</span> <span
  m='2974000'>Yes, I see someone giving the correct answer.</span> <span m='2977000'>I
  see some people not giving quite the correct answer.</span> <span m='2981000'>I
  see more and more correct answers.</span> <span m='2983000'>OK, so let's see. To
  figure out what type of</span> <span m='2989000'>point is, we should compute the
  second partial derivatives.</span> <span m='2992000'>So, fxx is, what do we get
  what we take the derivative of this</span> <span m='3002000'>with respect to x?
  Two over x^3y, OK?</span> <span m='3011000'>So, at our point, a will be 2. Fxy will
  be one over x^2y^2.</span> <span m='3025000'>So, B will be one. And, Fyy is going
  to be two</span> <span m='3037000'>over xy^3. So, C will be two.</span> <span m='3042000'>And
  so that tells us, well, AC-B^2 is four minus one.</span> <span m='3051000'>Sorry,
  I should probably use a different blackboard for that.</span> <span m='3062000'>AC-B2
  is two times two minus 1^2 is three.</span> <span m='3066000'>It's positive. That
  tells us we are either a</span> <span m='3070000'>local minimum or local maximum.
  And, A is positive.</span> <span m='3077000'>So, it's a local minimum. And, in fact,</span>
  <span m='3081000'>you can check it's the global minimum.</span> <span m='3083000'>What
  about the maximum? Well, if a maximum is not</span> <span m='3089000'>actually at
  a critical point, it's on the boundary,</span> <span m='3092000'>or at infinity.
  See, so we have actually to</span> <span m='3095000'>check what happens when x and
  y go to zero or to infinity.</span> <span m='3099000'>Well, if that happens, if
  x or y goes to infinity,</span> <span m='3102000'>then the function goes to infinity.</span>
  <span m='3104000'>Also, if x or y goes to zero, then one over xy goes to</span>
  <span m='3108000'>infinity. So, the maximum,</span> <span m='3111000'>well, the
  function goes to infinity when x goes to infinity</span> <span m='3119000'>or y
  goes to infinity, or x and y go to zero.</span> <span m='3125000'>So, it's not at
  a critical point.</span> <span m='3127000'>OK, so, in general, we have to check
  both the</span> <span m='3130000'>critical points and the boundaries to decide what</span>
  <span m='3133000'>happens. OK, the end.</span> <span m='3135000'>Have a nice weekend.</span>
