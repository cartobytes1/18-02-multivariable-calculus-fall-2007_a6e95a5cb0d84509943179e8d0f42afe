  <span m='24000'>We were looking at vector fields last time.</span> <span m='34000'>Last
  time we saw that if a vector field happens to be a</span> <span m='45000'>gradient
  field -- -- then the line integral can be computed</span> <span m='56000'>actually
  by taking the change in value of the potential between</span> <span m='68000'>the
  end point and the starting point of the curve.</span> <span m='79000'>If we have
  a curve c, from a point p0 to a point p1</span> <span m='84000'>then the line integral
  for work depends only on the end points</span> <span m='89000'>and not on the actual
  path we chose.</span> <span m='92000'>We say that the line integral is path independent.</span>
  <span m='103000'>And we also said that the vector field is conservative</span> <span
  m='109000'>because of conservation of energy which tells you if you</span> <span
  m='115000'>start at a point and you come back to the same point then you</span>
  <span m='122000'>haven't gotten any work out of that force.</span> <span m='127000'>If
  we have a closed curve then the line integral for work is</span> <span m='135000'>just
  zero. And, basically,</span> <span m='138000'>we say that these properties are equivalent
  being a gradient</span> <span m='143000'>field or being path independent or being
  conservative.</span> <span m='148000'>And what I promised to you is that today we
  would see a</span> <span m='151000'>criterion to decide whether a vector field is
  a gradient field</span> <span m='155000'>or not and how to find the potential function
  if it is a</span> <span m='158000'>gradient field. So, that is the topic for today.</span>
  <span m='167000'>The question is testing whether a given vector field,</span> <span
  m='180000'>let's say M and N compliments, is a gradient field.</span> <span m='194000'>For
  that, well, let's start with an</span> <span m='196000'>observation. Say that it
  is a gradient field.</span> <span m='206000'>That means that the first component
  of a field is just the</span> <span m='211000'>partial of f with respect to some
  variable x and the second</span> <span m='215000'>component is the partial of f
  with respect to y.</span> <span m='220000'>Now we have seen an interesting property
  of the second partial</span> <span m='223000'>derivatives of the function, which
  is if you take the</span> <span m='226000'>partial derivative first with respect
  to x,</span> <span m='229000'>then with respect to y, or first with respect to y,</span>
  <span m='232000'>then with respect to x you get the same thing.</span> <span m='238000'>We
  know f sub xy equals f sub yx, and that means M sub y</span> <span m='247000'>equals
  N sub x. If you have a gradient field</span> <span m='252000'>then it should have
  this property.</span> <span m='254000'>You take the y component, take the derivative
  with</span> <span m='257000'>respect to x, take the x component,</span> <span m='259000'>differentiate
  with respect to y,</span> <span m='260000'>you should get the same answer. And that
  is important to know.</span> <span m='271000'>So, I am going to put that in a box.</span>
  <span m='277000'>It is a broken box. The claim that I want to make</span> <span
  m='283000'>is that there is a converse of sorts.</span> <span m='285000'>This is
  actually basically all we need to check.</span> <span m='306000'>Conversely, if,
  and I am going to put here a</span> <span m='318000'>condition, My equals Nx, then
  F is a gradient field.</span> <span m='333000'>What is the condition that I need
  to put here?</span> <span m='335000'>Well, we will see a more precise version of
  that next</span> <span m='337000'>week. But for now let's just say if</span> <span
  m='344000'>our vector field is defined and differentiable everywhere in the</span>
  <span m='359000'>plane. We need, actually,</span> <span m='361000'>a vector field
  that is well-defined everywhere.</span> <span m='364000'>You are not allowed to
  have somehow places where it is not</span> <span m='367000'>well-defined. Otherwise,
  actually,</span> <span m='369000'>you have a counter example on your problem set
  this week.</span> <span m='373000'>If you look at the last problem on the problem
  set this week,</span> <span m='376000'>it gives you a vector field that satisfies
  this condition</span> <span m='380000'>everywhere where it is defined. But, actually,</span>
  <span m='382000'>there is a point where it is not defined.</span> <span m='384000'>And
  that causes it, actually, to somehow -- I mean</span> <span m='388000'>everything
  that I am going to say today breaks down for that</span> <span m='393000'>example
  because of that. I mean, we will shed more light</span> <span m='396000'>on this
  a bit later with the notion of simply connected</span> <span m='399000'>regions
  and so on. But for now let's just say if</span> <span m='402000'>it is defined everywhere
  and it satisfies this criterion then it</span> <span m='407000'>is a gradient field.
  If you ignore the technical</span> <span m='412000'>condition, being a gradient
  field means essentially the same</span> <span m='417000'>thing as having this property.
  That is what we need to check.</span> <span m='431000'>Let's look at an example.
  Well, one vector field that we</span> <span m='440000'>have been looking at a lot
  was - yi xj.</span> <span m='444000'>Remember that was the vector field that looked
  like a</span> <span m='450000'>rotation at the unit speed. I think last time we
  already</span> <span m='455000'>decided that this guy should not be allowed to be
  a gradient</span> <span m='459000'>field and should not be conservative because
  if we</span> <span m='462000'>integrate on the unit circle then we would get a positive</span>
  <span m='465000'>answer. But let's check that indeed it</span> <span m='469000'>fails
  our test. Well, let's call this M and</span> <span m='475000'>let's call this guy
  N. If you look at partial M,</span> <span m='481000'>partial y, that is going to
  be a negative one.</span> <span m='487000'>If you take partial N, partial x, that
  is going to be</span> <span m='491000'>one. These are not the same.</span> <span
  m='492000'>So, indeed, this is not a gradient field.</span> <span m='512000'>Any
  questions about that? Yes?</span> <span m='533000'>Your question is if I have the
  property M sub y equals N sub x</span> <span m='538000'>only in a certain part of
  a plane for some values of x and</span> <span m='543000'>y, can I conclude these
  things?</span> <span m='546000'>And it is a gradient field in that part of the plane
  and</span> <span m='549000'>conservative and so on. The answer for now is,</span>
  <span m='553000'>in general, no. And when we spend a bit more</span> <span m='557000'>time
  on it, actually, maybe I should move that up.</span> <span m='560000'>Maybe we will
  talk about it later this week instead of when</span> <span m='564000'>I had planned.
  There is a notion what it means</span> <span m='568000'>for a region to be without
  holes.</span> <span m='570000'>Basically, if you have that kind of property in a
  region</span> <span m='574000'>that doesn't have any holes inside it then things
  will work.</span> <span m='578000'>The problem comes from a vector field satisfying
  this criterion</span> <span m='582000'>in a region but it has a hole in it.</span>
  <span m='584000'>Because what you don't know is whether your potential is</span>
  <span m='587000'>actually well-defined and takes the same value when you move all</span>
  <span m='591000'>around the hole. It might come back to take a</span> <span m='593000'>different
  value. If you look carefully and think</span> <span m='596000'>hard about the example
  in the problem sets that is exactly</span> <span m='600000'>what happens there.
  Again, I will say more about</span> <span m='604000'>that later. For now we basically
  need our</span> <span m='608000'>function to be, I mean,</span> <span m='611000'>I
  should still say if you have this property for a vector field</span> <span m='614000'>that
  is not quite defined everywhere,</span> <span m='616000'>you are more than welcome,
  you know,</span> <span m='617000'>you should probably still try to look for a potential
  using</span> <span m='620000'>methods that we will see. But something might go wrong</span>
  <span m='623000'>later. You might end up with a</span> <span m='630000'>potential
  that is not well-defined.</span> <span m='639000'>Let's do another example. Let's
  say that I give you this</span> <span m='653000'>vector field. And this a here is
  a number.</span> <span m='663000'>The question is for which value of a is this going
  to be</span> <span m='668000'>possibly a gradient? If you have your flashcards</span>
  <span m='673000'>then that is a good time to use them to vote,</span> <span m='677000'>assuming
  that the number is small enough to be made with.</span> <span m='683000'>Let's try
  to think about it. We want to call this guy M.</span> <span m='687000'>We want to
  call that guy N. And we want to test M sub y</span> <span m='695000'>versus N sub
  x. I don't see anyone.</span> <span m='702000'>I see people doing it with their
  hands, and that works very</span> <span m='706000'>well. OK.</span> <span m='708000'>The
  question is for which value of a is this a gradient?</span> <span m='724000'>I see
  various people with the correct answer.</span> <span m='730000'>OK. That a strange
  answer.</span> <span m='735000'>That is a good answer. OK.</span> <span m='740000'>The
  vote seems to be for a equals eight.</span> <span m='748000'>Let's see. What if
  I take M sub y?</span> <span m='755000'>That is going to be just ax. And N sub x?</span>
  <span m='761000'>That is 8x. I would like a equals eight.</span> <span m='767000'>By
  the way, when you set these two equal to each other,</span> <span m='770000'>they
  really have to be equal everywhere.</span> <span m='772000'>You don't want to somehow
  solve for x or anything like that.</span> <span m='775000'>You just want these expressions,
  in terms of x and</span> <span m='779000'>y, to be the same quantities. I mean you
  cannot say if x</span> <span m='782000'>equals z they are always equal. Yeah, that
  is true.</span> <span m='787000'>But that is not what we are asking.</span> <span
  m='793000'>Now we come to the next logical question.</span> <span m='798000'>Let's
  say that we have passed the test.</span> <span m='800000'>We have put a equals eight
  in here.</span> <span m='803000'>Now it should be a gradient field.</span> <span
  m='806000'>The question is how do we find the potential?</span> <span m='810000'>That
  becomes eight from now on. The question is how do we find</span> <span m='816000'>the
  function which has this as gradient?</span> <span m='819000'>One option is to try
  to guess. Actually, quite often you will</span> <span m='823000'>succeed that way.
  But that is not a valid method</span> <span m='827000'>on next week's test. We are
  going to see two</span> <span m='830000'>different systematic methods. And you should
  be using one of</span> <span m='835000'>these because guessing doesn't always work.</span>
  <span m='840000'>And, actually, I can come up with examples</span> <span m='843000'>where
  if you try to guess you will surely fail.</span> <span m='847000'>I can come up
  with trick ones, but I don't want to put that on</span> <span m='855000'>the test.
  The next stage is finding the</span> <span m='864000'>potential. And let me just
  emphasize that</span> <span m='870000'>we can only do that if step one was successful.</span>
  <span m='876000'>If we have a vector field that cannot possibly be a gradient</span>
  <span m='881000'>then we shouldn't try to look for a potential.</span> <span m='885000'>It
  is kind of obvious but is probably worth pointing out.</span> <span m='892000'>There
  are two methods. The first method that we will</span> <span m='900000'>see is computing
  line integrals. Let's see how that works.</span> <span m='916000'>Let's say that
  I take some path that starts at the origin.</span> <span m='925000'>Or, actually,
  anywhere you want,</span> <span m='926000'>but let's take the origin. That is my
  favorite point.</span> <span m='929000'>And let's go to a point with coordinates
  (x1,</span> <span m='936000'>y1). And let's take my favorite</span> <span m='940000'>curve
  and compute the line integral of that field,</span> <span m='945000'>you know, the
  work done along the curve.</span> <span m='949000'>Well, by the fundamental theorem,
  that should be equal to</span> <span m='955000'>the value of the potential at the
  end point minus the value at</span> <span m='962000'>the origin. That means I can
  actually write</span> <span m='969000'>f of (x1, y1) equals -- -- that line integral
  plus the value at</span> <span m='979000'>the origin. And that is just a constant.</span>
  <span m='986000'>We don't know what it is. And, actually,</span> <span m='987000'>we
  can choose what it is. Because if you have a</span> <span m='990000'>potential,
  say that you have some potential function.</span> <span m='993000'>And let's say
  that you add one to it.</span> <span m='994000'>It is still a potential function.</span>
  <span m='996000'>Adding one doesn't change the gradient.</span> <span m='998000'>You
  can even add 18 or any number that you want.</span> <span m='1001000'>This is just
  going to be an integration constant.</span> <span m='1004000'>It is the same thing
  as, in one variable calculus,</span> <span m='1007000'>when you take the anti-derivative
  of a function it</span> <span m='1009000'>is only defined up to adding the constant.</span>
  <span m='1012000'>We have this integration constant, but apart from that we</span>
  <span m='1016000'>know that we should be able to get a potential from this.</span>
  <span m='1019000'>And this we can compute using the definition of the line</span>
  <span m='1023000'>integral. And we don't know what little f</span> <span m='1026000'>is,
  but we know what the vector field is so we can compute that.</span> <span m='1031000'>Of
  course, to do the calculation we probably don't</span> <span m='1034000'>want to
  use this kind of path. I mean if that is your favorite</span> <span m='1038000'>path
  then that is fine, but it is not very easy to</span> <span m='1041000'>compute the
  line integral along this,</span> <span m='1044000'>especially since I didn't tell
  you what the definition is.</span> <span m='1048000'>There are easier favorite paths
  to have.</span> <span m='1051000'>For example, you can go on a straight line</span>
  <span m='1053000'>from the origin to that point. That would be slightly easier.</span>
  <span m='1057000'>But then there is one easier. The easiest of all,</span> <span
  m='1060000'>probably, is to just go first along the x-axis to (x1,0) and</span>
  <span m='1067000'>then go up parallel to the y-axis.</span> <span m='1071000'>Why
  is that easy? Well, that is because when we</span> <span m='1074000'>do the line
  integral it becomes M dx N dy.</span> <span m='1077000'>And then, on each of these
  pieces, one-half just goes away</span> <span m='1085000'>because x, y is constant.
  Let's try to use that method in</span> <span m='1091000'>our example.</span> <span
  m='1125000'>Let's say that I want to go along this path from the origin,</span>
  <span m='1136000'>first along the x-axis to (x1,0) and then vertically to</span>
  <span m='1146000'>(x1, y1). And so I want to compute for</span> <span m='1154000'>the
  line integral along that curve.</span> <span m='1161000'>Let's say I want to do
  it for this vector field.</span> <span m='1164000'>I want to find the potential
  for this vector field.</span> <span m='1173000'>Let me copy it because I will have
  to erase at some point.</span> <span m='1177000'>4x squared plus 8xy and 3y squared
  plus 4x squared.</span> <span m='1190000'>That will become the integral of 4x squared
  plus 8 xy times dx</span> <span m='1199000'>plus 3y squared plus 4x squared times
  dy.</span> <span m='1205000'>To evaluate on this broken line, I will,</span> <span
  m='1208000'>of course, evaluate separately on each of the two segments.</span> <span
  m='1213000'>I will start with this segment that I will call c1 and then I</span>
  <span m='1220000'>will do this one that I will call c2.</span> <span m='1225000'>On
  c1, how do I evaluate my integral?</span> <span m='1230000'>Well, if I am on c1
  then x varies from zero to x1.</span> <span m='1238000'>Well, actually, I don't
  know if x1 is positive</span> <span m='1240000'>or not so I shouldn't write this.</span>
  <span m='1241000'>I really should say just x goes from zero to x1.</span> <span
  m='1248000'>And what about y? y is just 0.</span> <span m='1254000'>I will set y
  equal to zero and also dy equal to zero.</span> <span m='1260000'>I get that the
  line integral on c1 -- Well, a lot of stuff goes</span> <span m='1268000'>away.
  The entire second term with dy</span> <span m='1271000'>goes away because dy is
  zero. And, in the first term,</span> <span m='1275000'>8xy goes away because y is
  zero as well.</span> <span m='1278000'>I just have an integral of 4x squared dx
  from zero to x1.</span> <span m='1287000'>By the way, now you see why I have been
  using an x1 and a y1</span> <span m='1291000'>for my point and not just x and y.</span>
  <span m='1293000'>It is to avoid confusion. I am using x and y as my</span> <span
  m='1296000'>integration variables and x1, y1 as constants that are</span> <span
  m='1301000'>representing the end point of my path.</span> <span m='1305000'>And
  so, if I integrate this, I should get four-thirds x1</span> <span m='1311000'>cubed.
  That is the first part.</span> <span m='1314000'>Next I need to do the second segment.</span>
  <span m='1321000'>If I am on c2, y goes from zero to y1.</span> <span m='1329000'>And
  what about x? x is constant equal to x1 so dx</span> <span m='1336000'>becomes just
  zero. It is a constant.</span> <span m='1342000'>If I take the line integral of
  c2, F dot dr then I will get the</span> <span m='1350000'>integral from zero to
  y1. The entire first term with dx</span> <span m='1357000'>goes away and then I
  have 3y squared plus 4x1 squared times</span> <span m='1367000'>dy. That integrates
  to y cubed plus</span> <span m='1372000'>4x1 squared y from zero to y1. Or, if you
  prefer,</span> <span m='1381000'>that is y1 cubed plus 4x1 squared y1.</span> <span
  m='1391000'>Now that we have done both of them we can just add them</span> <span
  m='1395000'>together, and that will give us the formula for the potential.</span>
  <span m='1420000'>F of x1 and y1 is four-thirds x1 cubed plus y1 cubed plus 4x1</span>
  <span m='1430000'>squared y1 plus a constant. That constant is just the</span> <span
  m='1437000'>integration constant that we had from the beginning.</span> <span m='1443000'>Now
  you can drop the subscripts if you prefer.</span> <span m='1445000'>You can just
  say f is four-thirds x cubed plus y cubed</span> <span m='1454000'>plus 4x squared
  y plus constant. And you can check.</span> <span m='1460000'>If you take the gradient
  of this, you should get again this</span> <span m='1465000'>vector field over there.
  Any questions about this method?</span> <span m='1469000'>Yes? No.</span> <span
  m='1473000'>Well, it depends whether you are just trying to find one</span> <span
  m='1475000'>potential or if you are trying to find all the possible</span> <span
  m='1478000'>potentials. If a problem just says find a</span> <span m='1480000'>potential
  then you don't have to use the constant.</span> <span m='1483000'>This guy without
  the constant is a valid potential.</span> <span m='1487000'>You just have others.
  If your neighbor comes to you</span> <span m='1492000'>and say your answer must
  be wrong because I got this plus</span> <span m='1498000'>18, well, both answers
  are correct.</span> <span m='1501000'>By the way. Instead of going first along</span>
  <span m='1505000'>the x-axis vertically, you could do it the other way</span> <span
  m='1508000'>around. Of course, start along the</span> <span m='1511000'>y-axis and
  then horizontally. That is the same level of</span> <span m='1515000'>difficulty.
  You just exchange roles of x</span> <span m='1519000'>and y. In some cases,</span>
  <span m='1521000'>it is actually even making more sense maybe to go radially,</span>
  <span m='1526000'>start out from the origin to your end point.</span> <span m='1530000'>But
  usually this setting is easier just because each of</span> <span m='1537000'>these
  two guys were very easy to compute.</span> <span m='1543000'>But somehow maybe if
  you suspect that polar coordinates</span> <span m='1546000'>will be involved somehow
  in the answer then maybe it makes sense</span> <span m='1549000'>to choose different
  paths. Maybe a straight line is better.</span> <span m='1561000'>Now we have another
  method to look at which is using</span> <span m='1573000'>anti-derivatives. The
  goal is the same,</span> <span m='1579000'>still to find the potential function.</span>
  <span m='1581000'>And you see that finding the potential is really the</span> <span
  m='1586000'>multivariable analog of finding the anti-derivative in the one</span>
  <span m='1591000'>variable. Here we did it basically by</span> <span m='1594000'>hand
  by computing the integral. The other thing you could try</span> <span m='1598000'>to
  say is, wait, I already know how to take</span> <span m='1599000'>anti-derivatives.
  Let's use that instead of</span> <span m='1602000'>computing integrals. And it works
  but you have to be</span> <span m='1605000'>careful about how you do it. Let's see
  how that works.</span> <span m='1611000'>Let's still do it with the same example.</span>
  <span m='1613000'>We want to solve the equations. We want a function such that f</span>
  <span m='1622000'>sub x is 4x squared plus 8xy and f sub y is 3y squared plus 4x</span>
  <span m='1633000'>squared. Let's just look at one of these</span> <span m='1636000'>at
  a time. If we look at this one,</span> <span m='1640000'>well, we know how to solve
  this because it is just telling us we</span> <span m='1648000'>have to integrate
  this with respect to x.</span> <span m='1653000'>Well, let's call them one and two
  because I will have to refer</span> <span m='1658000'>to them again. Let's start
  with equation one</span> <span m='1663000'>and lets integrate with respect to x.</span>
  <span m='1668000'>Well, it tells us that f should be,</span> <span m='1671000'>what
  do I get when I integrate this with respect to x,</span> <span m='1675000'>four-thirds
  x cubed plus, when I integrate 8xy,</span> <span m='1682000'>y is just a constant,
  so I will get 4x squared y.</span> <span m='1688000'>And that is not quite the end
  to it because there is an</span> <span m='1691000'>integration constant. And here,
  when I say there is</span> <span m='1695000'>an integration constant, it just means
  the extra term</span> <span m='1698000'>does not depend on x. That is what it means
  to be a</span> <span m='1701000'>constant in this setting. But maybe my constant
  still</span> <span m='1705000'>depends on y so it is not actually a true constant.</span>
  <span m='1708000'>A constant that depends on y is not really a constant.</span>
  <span m='1710000'>It is actually a function of y. The good news that we have is</span>
  <span m='1718000'>that this function normally depends on x.</span> <span m='1720000'>We
  have made some progress. We have part of the answer and</span> <span m='1726000'>we
  have simplified the problem. If we have anything that looks</span> <span m='1733000'>like
  this, it will satisfy the first condition.</span> <span m='1736000'>Now we need
  to look at the second condition.</span> <span m='1739000'>We want f sub y to be
  that. But we know what f is,</span> <span m='1752000'>so let's compute f sub y from
  this.</span> <span m='1755000'>From this I get f sub y. What do I get if I</span>
  <span m='1760000'>differentiate this with respect to y?</span> <span m='1762000'>Well,
  I get zero plus 4x squared plus the derivative of</span> <span m='1777000'>g. I
  would like to match this with</span> <span m='1786000'>what I had. If I match this
  with equation</span> <span m='1791000'>two then that will tell me what the derivative
  of g should be.</span> <span m='1815000'>If we compare the two things there, we
  get 4x squared plus g</span> <span m='1820000'>prime of y should be equal to 3y
  squared by 4x squared.</span> <span m='1826000'>And, of course, the 4x squares go
  away.</span> <span m='1831000'>That tells you g prime is 3y squared.</span> <span
  m='1835000'>And that integrates to y cubed plus constant.</span> <span m='1842000'>Now,
  this time the constant is a true constant because g did</span> <span m='1846000'>not
  depend on anything other than y.</span> <span m='1848000'>And the constant does
  not depend on y so it is a real</span> <span m='1854000'>constant now. Now we just
  plug this back into</span> <span m='1858000'>this guy. Let's call him star.</span>
  <span m='1865000'>If we plug this into star, we get f equals four-thirds x</span>
  <span m='1873000'>cubed plus 4x squared y plus y cubed plus constant.</span> <span
  m='1881000'>I mean, of course, again, now this constant is</span> <span m='1890000'>optional.
  The advantage of this method is</span> <span m='1893000'>you don't have to write
  any integrals.</span> <span m='1895000'>The small drawback is you have to follow
  this procedure</span> <span m='1900000'>carefully. By the way, one common pitfall</span>
  <span m='1905000'>that is tempting. After you have done this,</span> <span m='1908000'>what
  is very tempting is to just say, well,</span> <span m='1911000'>let's do the same
  with this guy.</span> <span m='1913000'>Let's integrate this with respect to y.</span>
  <span m='1915000'>You will get another expression for f up to a constant that</span>
  <span m='1918000'>depends on x. And then let's match them.</span> <span m='1921000'>Well,
  the difficulty is matching is actually quite</span> <span m='1924000'>tricky because
  you don't know in advance whether they will be the</span> <span m='1929000'>same
  expression. It could be you could say let's</span> <span m='1933000'>just take the
  terms that are here and missing there and</span> <span m='1936000'>combine the terms,
  you know, take all the terms</span> <span m='1940000'>that appear in either one.
  That is actually not a good way</span> <span m='1943000'>to do it, because if I
  put sufficiently</span> <span m='1945000'>complicated trig functions in there then
  you might not be able</span> <span m='1948000'>to see that two terms are the same.</span>
  <span m='1950000'>Take an easy one. Let's say that here I have one</span> <span
  m='1954000'>plus tangent square and here I have a secan square then you</span> <span
  m='1960000'>might not actually notice that there is a difference.</span> <span m='1966000'>But
  there is no difference. Whatever.</span> <span m='1970000'>Anyway, I am saying do
  it this way, don't do it any other way</span> <span m='1974000'>because there is
  a risk of making a mistake otherwise.</span> <span m='1977000'>I mean, on the other
  hand, you could start with</span> <span m='1980000'>integrating with respect to
  y and then differentiate and match</span> <span m='1983000'>with respect to x. But
  what I am saying is just</span> <span m='1986000'>take one of them, integrate,</span>
  <span m='1989000'>get an answer that involves a function of the other variable,</span>
  <span m='1992000'>then differentiate that answer and compare and see what you</span>
  <span m='1998000'>get. By the way, here,</span> <span m='2001000'>of course, after
  we simplified there were only y's here.</span> <span m='2007000'>There were no x's.
  And that is kind of good news.</span> <span m='2009000'>I mean, if you had had an
  x here in this expression that</span> <span m='2013000'>would have told you that
  something is going wrong.</span> <span m='2016000'>g is a function of y only. If
  you get an x here,</span> <span m='2019000'>maybe you want to go back and check
  whether it is really a</span> <span m='2022000'>gradient field. Yes?</span> <span
  m='2027000'>Yes, this will work with functions of more than two</span> <span m='2029000'>variables.
  Both methods work with more</span> <span m='2031000'>than two variables. We are
  going to see it in the</span> <span m='2033000'>case where more than two means three.</span>
  <span m='2036000'>We are going to see that in two or three weeks from now.</span>
  <span m='2040000'>I mean, basically starting at the end of next week,</span> <span
  m='2044000'>we are going to do triple integrals, line integrals in</span> <span
  m='2048000'>space and so on. The format is first we do</span> <span m='2050000'>everything
  in two variables. Then we will do three variables.</span> <span m='2053000'>And
  then what happens with more than three will be left to your</span> <span m='2060000'>imagination.
  Any other questions about</span> <span m='2065000'>either of these methods? A quick
  poll.</span> <span m='2069000'>Who prefers the first method? Who prefers the second
  method?</span> <span m='2074000'>Wow. OK.</span> <span m='2081000'>Anyway, you will
  get to use whichever one you want.</span> <span m='2085000'>And I would agree with
  you, but the second method is</span> <span m='2087000'>slightly more effective in
  that you are writing less stuff.</span> <span m='2090000'>You don't have to set
  up all these line integrals.</span> <span m='2094000'>On the other hand, it does
  require a little bit</span> <span m='2103000'>more attention. Let's move on a bit.</span>
  <span m='2119000'>Let me start by actually doing a small recap.</span> <span m='2124000'>We
  said we have various notions. One is to say that the vector</span> <span m='2138000'>field
  is a gradient in a certain region of a plane.</span> <span m='2148000'>And we have
  another notion which is being conservative.</span> <span m='2154000'>It says that
  the line integral is zero along any closed curve.</span> <span m='2166000'>Actually,
  let me introduce a new piece of notation.</span> <span m='2170000'>To remind ourselves
  that we are doing it along a closed curve,</span> <span m='2174000'>very often we
  put just a circle for the integral to tell us this</span> <span m='2178000'>is a
  curve that closes on itself.</span> <span m='2181000'>It ends where it started.
  I mean it doesn't change</span> <span m='2185000'>anything concerning the definition
  or how you compute it</span> <span m='2188000'>or anything. It just reminds you
  that you</span> <span m='2191000'>are doing it on a closed curve. It is actually
  useful for</span> <span m='2194000'>various physical applications. And also, when
  you state</span> <span m='2197000'>theorems in that way, it reminds you,oh..</span>
  <span m='2201000'>I need to be on a closed curve to do it.</span> <span m='2205000'>And
  so we have said these two things are equivalent.</span> <span m='2211000'>Now we
  have a third thing which is N sub x equals M sub y at</span> <span m='2220000'>every
  point. Just to summarize the</span> <span m='2223000'>discussion. We have said if
  we have a</span> <span m='2226000'>gradient field then we have this.</span> <span
  m='2229000'>And the converse is true in suitable regions.</span> <span m='2238000'>We
  have a converse if F is defined in the entire plane.</span> <span m='2252000'>Or,
  as we will see soon, in a simply connected region.</span> <span m='2263000'>I guess
  some of you cannot see what I am writing here,</span> <span m='2265000'>but it doesn't
  matter because you are not officially supposed</span> <span m='2268000'>to know
  it yet. That will be next week.</span> <span m='2273000'>Anyway, I said the fact
  that Nx equals</span> <span m='2277000'>My implies that we have a gradient field
  and is only if a</span> <span m='2281000'>vector field is defined in the entire
  plane or in a region that</span> <span m='2286000'>is called simply connected. And
  more about that later.</span> <span m='2292000'>Now let me just introduce a quantity
  that probably a lot of</span> <span m='2297000'>you have heard about in physics
  that measures precisely fairly</span> <span m='2302000'>ought to be conservative.
  That is called the curl of a</span> <span m='2306000'>vector field.</span> <span
  m='2346000'>For the definition we say that the curl of F is the quantity N</span>
  <span m='2359000'>sub x - M sub y. It is just replicating the</span> <span m='2367000'>information
  we had but in a way that is a single quantity.</span> <span m='2375000'>In this
  new language, the conditions that we had over</span> <span m='2383000'>there, this
  condition says curl F equals zero.</span> <span m='2390000'>That is the new version
  of Nx equals My.</span> <span m='2396000'>It measures failure of a vector field
  to be conservative.</span> <span m='2406000'>The test for conservativeness is that
  the curl of F should be</span> <span m='2421000'>zero. I should probably tell you
  a</span> <span m='2425000'>little bit about what the curl is, what it measures and
  what it</span> <span m='2429000'>does because that is something that is probably
  useful.</span> <span m='2434000'>It is a very strange quantity if you put it in
  that form.</span> <span m='2437000'>Yes? I think it is the same as the</span> <span
  m='2442000'>physics one, but I haven't checked the physics textbook.</span> <span
  m='2445000'>I believe it is the same. Yes, I think it is the same as</span> <span
  m='2449000'>the physics one. It is not the opposite this</span> <span m='2453000'>time.
  Of course, in physics maybe you</span> <span m='2455000'>have seen curl in space.
  We are going to see curl in</span> <span m='2459000'>space in two or three weeks.
  Yes?</span> <span m='2467000'>Yes. Well, you can also use it. If you fail this test
  then you</span> <span m='2471000'>know for sure that you are not gradient field
  so you might as</span> <span m='2474000'>well do that. If you satisfy the test but
  you</span> <span m='2478000'>are not defined everywhere then there is still a bit
  of</span> <span m='2484000'>ambiguity and you don't know for sure.</span> <span
  m='2489000'>OK. Let's try to see a little bit</span> <span m='2500000'>what the
  curl measures. Just to give you some</span> <span m='2508000'>intuition, let's first
  think about a velocity field.</span> <span m='2515000'>The curl measures the rotation
  component of a motion.</span> <span m='2530000'>If you want a fancy word, it measures
  the vorticity of a</span> <span m='2533000'>motion. It tells you how much twisting</span>
  <span m='2536000'>is taking place at a given point.</span> <span m='2539000'>For
  example, if I take a constant vector</span> <span m='2544000'>field where my fluid
  is just all moving in the same direction</span> <span m='2552000'>where this is
  just constants then,</span> <span m='2557000'>of course, the curl is zero. Because
  if you take the</span> <span m='2561000'>partials you get zero. And, indeed,</span>
  <span m='2563000'>that is not what you would call swirling.</span> <span m='2566000'>There
  is no vortex in here. Let's do another one where this</span> <span m='2578000'>is
  still nothing going on. Let's say that I take the</span> <span m='2582000'>radial
  vector field where everything just flows away from</span> <span m='2586000'>the
  origin. That is f equals x, y.</span> <span m='2591000'>Well, if I take the curl,
  I have to take partial over</span> <span m='2596000'>partial x of the second component,</span>
  <span m='2598000'>which is y, minus partial over partial y of</span> <span m='2601000'>the
  first component, which is x.</span> <span m='2602000'>I will get zero. And, indeed,</span>
  <span m='2605000'>if you think about what is going on here,</span> <span m='2609000'>there
  is no rotation involved. On the other hand,</span> <span m='2612000'>if you consider
  our favorite rotation vector field -- --</span> <span m='2625000'>negative y and
  x then this curl is going to be N sub x minus M</span> <span m='2640000'>sub y,
  one plus one equals two.</span> <span m='2648000'>That corresponds to the fact that
  we are rotating.</span> <span m='2653000'>Actually, we are rotating at unit angular
  speed.</span> <span m='2656000'>The curl actually measures twice the angular speed
  of a</span> <span m='2660000'>rotation part of a motion at any given point.</span>
  <span m='2664000'>Now, if you have an actual motion,</span> <span m='2666000'>a
  more complicated field than these then no matter where you</span> <span m='2670000'>are
  you can think of a motion as a combination of translation</span> <span m='2674000'>effects,
  maybe dilation effects,</span> <span m='2677000'>maybe rotation effects, possibly
  other things like that.</span> <span m='2683000'>And what a curl will measure is
  how intense the rotation effect</span> <span m='2688000'>is at that particular point.
  I am not going to try to make a</span> <span m='2692000'>much more precise statement.
  A precise statement is what a</span> <span m='2695000'>curl measures is really this
  quantity up there.</span> <span m='2698000'>But the intuition you should have is
  it measures how much</span> <span m='2701000'>rotation is taking place at any given
  point.</span> <span m='2704000'>And, of course, in a complicated motion you</span>
  <span m='2706000'>might have more rotation at some point than at some others,</span>
  <span m='2709000'>which is why the curl will depend on x and y.</span> <span m='2712000'>It
  is not just a constant because how much you rotate</span> <span m='2720000'>depends
  on where you are. If you are looking at actual</span> <span m='2726000'>wind velocities
  in weather prediction then the regions with</span> <span m='2730000'>high curl tend
  to be hurricanes or tornadoes or things like</span> <span m='2733000'>that. They
  are not very pleasant</span> <span m='2737000'>things. And the sign of a curl tells</span>
  <span m='2740000'>you whether you are going clockwise or counterclockwise.</span>
  <span m='2769000'>Curl measures twice the angular velocity of the rotation</span>
  <span m='2787000'>component of a velocity field. Now, what about a force field?</span>
  <span m='2801000'>Because, after all, how we got to this was coming</span> <span
  m='2804000'>from and trying to understand forces and the work they do.</span> <span
  m='2807000'>So I should tell you what it means for a force.</span> <span m='2810000'>Well,
  the curl of a force field -- -- measures the torque</span> <span m='2830000'>exerted
  on a test object that you put at any point.</span> <span m='2849000'>Remember, torque
  is the rotational analog of the force.</span> <span m='2856000'>We had this analogy
  about velocity versus angular velocity</span> <span m='2861000'>and mass versus
  moment of inertia.</span> <span m='2865000'>And then, in that analogy, force divided
  by the mass is</span> <span m='2869000'>what will cause acceleration, which is the
  derivative of</span> <span m='2873000'>velocity. Torque divided by moment of</span>
  <span m='2876000'>inertia is what will cause the angular acceleration,</span> <span
  m='2879000'>namely the derivative of angular velocity.</span> <span m='2882000'>Maybe
  I should write that down.</span> <span m='2898000'>Torque divided by moment of inertia
  is going to be d over dt</span> <span m='2911000'>of angular velocity. I leave it
  up to your physics</span> <span m='2918000'>teachers to decide what letters to use
  for all these things.</span> <span m='2921000'>That is the analog of force divided
  by mass equals</span> <span m='2929000'>acceleration, which is d over dt of velocity.</span>
  <span m='2936000'>And so now you see if the curl of a velocity field measure the</span>
  <span m='2943000'>angular velocity of its rotation then,</span> <span m='2947000'>by
  this analogy, the curl of a force field</span> <span m='2953000'>should measure
  the torque it exerts on a mass per unit moment</span> <span m='2964000'>of inertia.
  Concretely, if you imagine that</span> <span m='2968000'>you are putting something
  in there,</span> <span m='2969000'>you know, if you are in a velocity field the
  curl will</span> <span m='2972000'>tell you how fast your guy is spinning at a given
  time.</span> <span m='2975000'>If you put something that floats, for example,</span>
  <span m='2977000'>in your fluid, something very light then it is</span> <span m='2980000'>going
  to start spinning. And the curl of a velocity</span> <span m='2984000'>field tells
  you how fast it is spinning at any given time up to</span> <span m='2988000'>a factor
  of two. And the curl of a force field</span> <span m='2991000'>tells you how quickly
  the angular velocity is going to</span> <span m='2995000'>increase or decrease.
  OK.</span> <span m='3001000'>Well, next time we are going to see Green's theorem
  which is</span> <span m='3004000'>actually going to tell us a lot more about curl
  and failure of</span> <span m='3008000'>conservativeness.</span> </p>
