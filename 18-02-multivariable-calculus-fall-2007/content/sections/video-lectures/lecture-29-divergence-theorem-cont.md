  \ at ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='23000'>OK, so remember we left things with this\
  \ statement of the</span> <span m='29000'>divergence theorem. So, the divergence\
  \ theorem</span> <span m='33000'>gives us a way to compute the flux of a vector\
  \ field for a</span> <span m='36000'>closed surface. OK, it says if I have a closed</span>\
  \ <span m='41000'>surface, s, bounding some region, D,</span> <span m='47000'>and\
  \ I have a vector field defined in space,</span> <span m='54000'>so that I can try\
  \ to compute the flux of my vector field</span> <span m='59000'>through my surface.\
  \ Double integral of F.dS or</span> <span m='64000'>F.ndS if you want, and to set\
  \ this up,</span> <span m='68000'>of course, I need to use the geometry of the surface</span>\
  \ <span m='71000'>depending on what the surface is.</span> <span m='73000'>We've\
  \ seen various formulas for how to set up the double</span> <span m='77000'>integral.\
  \ But, we've also seen that if</span> <span m='80000'>it's a closed surface, and\
  \ if a vector field is</span> <span m='84000'>defined everywhere inside, then we\
  \ can actually reduce</span> <span m='89000'>that to a calculation of the triple\
  \ integral of the</span> <span m='94000'>divergence of F inside, OK?</span> <span\
  \ m='98000'>So, concretely, if I use</span> <span m='100000'>coordinates, let's\
  \ say that the coordinates</span> <span m='103000'>of my vector field are, sorry,\
  \ the components are P,</span> <span m='108000'>Q, and R dot ndS, then that will\
  \ become the</span> <span m='112000'>triple integral of, well, so, divergence is\
  \ P sub x</span> <span m='120000'>plus Q sub y plus R sub z. OK, so by the way,</span>\
  \ <span m='127000'>how to remember this formula for divergence,</span> <span m='130000'>and\
  \ other formulas for other things as well.</span> <span m='134000'>Let me just tell\
  \ you quickly about the del notation.</span> <span m='142000'>So, this guy usually\
  \ pronounced as</span> <span m='147000'>del, rather than as pointy triangle</span>\
  \ <span m='149000'>going downwards or something like that,</span> <span m='152000'>it's\
  \ a symbolic notation for an operator.</span> <span m='157000'>So, you're probably\
  \ going to complain about putting these</span> <span m='162000'>guys into a vector.\
  \ But, let's think of partial</span> <span m='166000'>with respect to x, with respect\
  \ to y,</span> <span m='168000'>and with respect to z as the components of some\
  \ formal</span> <span m='171000'>vector. Of course, it's not a real</span> <span\
  \ m='173000'>vector. These are not like anything.</span> <span m='175000'>These\
  \ are just symbols. But, so see for example,</span> <span m='182000'>the gradient\
  \ of function, well, if you multiply this</span> <span m='186000'>vector by scalar,\
  \ which is a function,</span> <span m='189000'>then you will get partial, partial\
  \ x of f,</span> <span m='194000'>partial, partial y of f, partial, partial z, f,</span>\
  \ <span m='200000'>well, that's the gradient. That seems to work.</span> <span m='205000'>So\
  \ now, the interesting thing about divergence is I can think</span> <span m='209000'>of\
  \ divergence as del dot a vector field.</span> <span m='213000'>See, if I do the\
  \ dot product between this guy and my vector</span> <span m='222000'>field P, Q,\
  \ R, well, it looks like I will</span> <span m='226000'>indeed get partial, partial\
  \ x of P plus partial Q</span> <span m='231000'>partial y plus partial R partial\
  \ z.</span> <span m='236000'>That's the divergence. and of course, similarly,</span>\
  \ <span m='246000'>when we have two variables only, x and y,</span> <span m='248000'>we\
  \ could have thought of the same notation,</span> <span m='251000'>just with a two\
  \ component vector,</span> <span m='253000'>partial, partial x, partial, partial\
  \ y.</span> <span m='256000'>So, now, this is like of slightly limited usefulness\
  \ so</span> <span m='260000'>far. It's going to become very handy</span> <span m='262000'>pretty\
  \ soon because we are going to see curl.</span> <span m='265000'>And, the formula\
  \ for curl in the plane was kind of</span> <span m='268000'>complicated. But, if\
  \ you thought about it in</span> <span m='271000'>terms of this, it was actually\
  \ the determinant</span> <span m='274000'>of del and f. And now, in space,</span>\
  \ <span m='276000'>we are actually going to do del cross f.</span> <span m='279000'>But,\
  \ I'm getting ahead of things.</span> <span m='280000'>So, let's not do anything\
  \ with that.</span> <span m='284000'>Curl will be for next week. Just getting you\
  \ used to the</span> <span m='292000'>notation, especially since you might be using\
  \ it in physics</span> <span m='294000'>already. So, it might be worth doing.</span>\
  \ <span m='299000'>OK, so the other thing I wanted to say is, what does this</span>\
  \ <span m='303000'>theorem say physically? How should I think of this</span> <span\
  \ m='306000'>statement? So, I think I said that very</span> <span m='309000'>quickly\
  \ at the end of last time, but not very carefully.</span> <span m='313000'>So, what's\
  \ the physical interpretation of a divergence</span> <span m='322000'>field? So,</span>\
  \ <span m='326000'>I want to claim that the divergence of a vector field</span>\
  \ <span m='330000'>corresponds to what I'm going to call the source rate,</span>\
  \ <span m='335000'>which is somehow the amount of flux generated per unit volume.</span>\
  \ <span m='352000'>So, to understand what that means, let's think of what's</span>\
  \ <span m='356000'>called an incompressible fluid. OK, so an incompressible fluid</span>\
  \ <span m='360000'>is something like water, for example,</span> <span m='362000'>where\
  \ a fixed mass of it always occupies the same amount of</span> <span m='366000'>volume.\
  \ So, guesses are compressible.</span> <span m='369000'>Liquids are incompressible,\
  \ basically.</span> <span m='373000'>So, if you have an incompressible fluid flow\
  \ -- --</span> <span m='384000'>well, so, again, what that means is really,</span>\
  \ <span m='394000'>given mass occupies always a fixed volume.</span> <span m='404000'>Then,\
  \ well, let's say that we have such a fluid with velocity</span> <span m='411000'>given\
  \ by our vector field. OK, so we're thinking of F as</span> <span m='417000'>the\
  \ velocity and maybe something containing water,</span> <span m='423000'>a pipe,\
  \ or something. So, what does the divergence</span> <span m='428000'>theorem say?\
  \ It says that if I take a region</span> <span m='434000'>in space, let's call it\
  \ D,</span> <span m='438000'>sorry, D is the inside, and S is the surface around\
  \ it,</span> <span m='443000'>well, so if I sum the divergence in D,</span> <span\
  \ m='447000'>well, I'm going to get the flux going out through this surface,</span>\
  \ <span m='455000'>S. I should have mentioned it</span> <span m='457000'>earlier.\
  \ The convention in the</span> <span m='459000'>divergence theorem is that we orient\
  \ the surface with a normal</span> <span m='463000'>vector pointing always outwards.\
  \ OK, so now, we know what flux</span> <span m='467000'>means. Remember, we've been</span>\
  \ <span m='469000'>describing, flux means how much fluid is passing through this</span>\
  \ <span m='473000'>surface. So, that's the amount of fluid</span> <span m='480000'>that's\
  \ leaving the region, D, per unit time.</span> <span m='491000'>And, of course,\
  \ when I'm saying that,</span> <span m='493000'>it means I'm counting everything\
  \ that's going out of D</span> <span m='496000'>minus everything that's coming into\
  \ D.</span> <span m='498000'>That's what the flux measures. So, now, if there is\
  \ stuff</span> <span m='502000'>coming into D or going out of D, well, it must come\
  \ from</span> <span m='506000'>somewhere. So, one possibility would be</span> <span\
  \ m='508000'>that your fluid is actually being compressed or expanded.</span> <span\
  \ m='512000'>But, I've said, no, I'm looking at something</span> <span m='514000'>like\
  \ water that you cannot squish into smaller volume.</span> <span m='517000'>So,\
  \ in that case, the only explanation is that</span> <span m='520000'>there is something\
  \ it here that actually is sucking up water or</span> <span m='524000'>producing\
  \ more water. And so, integrating the</span> <span m='527000'>divergence gives you\
  \ the total amount of sources minus the</span> <span m='532000'>amount of syncs\
  \ that are inside this region.</span> <span m='536000'>So, the divergence itself\
  \ measures basically the amount of</span> <span m='541000'>sources or syncs per\
  \ unit volume in a given place.</span> <span m='546000'>And now, if you think about\
  \ it that way,</span> <span m='547000'>well, it's basically the divergence</span>\
  \ <span m='552000'>theorem is just stating something completely obvious</span> <span\
  \ m='557000'>about all the matter that is leaving this region must come</span> <span\
  \ m='563000'>from somewhere. So, that's basically how we</span> <span m='568000'>think\
  \ about it. Now, of course,</span> <span m='570000'>if you're doing 8.02, then you\
  \ might actually have</span> <span m='573000'>seen the divergence theorem already\
  \ being used for things</span> <span m='575000'>that are more like force fields,\
  \ say, electric fields and so on.</span> <span m='579000'>Well, I'll try to say\
  \ a few things about that during the</span> <span m='582000'>last week of classes.\
  \ But, then this kind of</span> <span m='585000'>interpretation doesn't quite work.</span>\
  \ <span m='588000'>OK, any questions, generally speaking,</span> <span m='591000'>before\
  \ we move on to the proof and other applications?</span> <span m='596000'>Yes? Oh,\
  \ not the gradient.</span> <span m='605000'>So, yeah, the divergence of F measures\
  \ the amount of sources</span> <span m='609000'>or syncs in there. Well, what makes\
  \ it happen?</span> <span m='611000'>If you want, in a way, it's this theorem.</span>\
  \ <span m='613000'>Or, in another way, if you think about it,</span> <span m='616000'>try\
  \ to look at your favorite vector fields and compute their</span> <span m='620000'>divergence.\
  \ And, if you take a vector field</span> <span m='623000'>where maybe everything\
  \ is rotating,</span> <span m='625000'>a flow that's just rotating about some axis,</span>\
  \ <span m='629000'>then you'll find that its divergence is zero.</span> <span m='631000'>If\
  \ you, sorry? No, divergence is not equal to</span> <span m='637000'>the gradient.\
  \ Sorry, there's a dot here that</span> <span m='639000'>maybe is not very big,\
  \ but it's very important.</span> <span m='642000'>OK, so you take the divergence\
  \ of a vector field.</span> <span m='644000'>Well, you take the gradient of a function.</span>\
  \ <span m='646000'>So, if the gradient of a function is a vector,</span> <span m='649000'>the\
  \ divergence of a vector field is a function.</span> <span m='652000'>So, somehow\
  \ these guys go back and forth between.</span> <span m='656000'>So, I should have\
  \ said, with new notations comes new</span> <span m='659000'>responsibility. I mean,</span>\
  \ <span m='664000'>now that we have this nice, nifty notation that will let us</span>\
  \ <span m='667000'>do gradient divergence and later curl in a unified way,</span>\
  \ <span m='670000'>if you choose this notation you have to be really,</span> <span\
  \ m='672000'>really careful what you put after it because otherwise it's</span>\
  \ <span m='677000'>easy to get completely confused. OK, so divergence and gradients</span>\
  \ <span m='681000'>are completely different things. The only thing they have in</span>\
  \ <span m='684000'>common is that both are what's called a first order</span> <span\
  \ m='686000'>differential operator. That means it involves the</span> <span m='689000'>first\
  \ partial derivatives of whatever you put into it.</span> <span m='693000'>But,\
  \ one of them goes from functions to vectors.</span> <span m='695000'>That's gradient.\
  \ The other one goes from vectors</span> <span m='698000'>to functions. That's divergence.</span>\
  \ <span m='701000'>And, curl later will go from vectors to vectors.</span> <span\
  \ m='703000'>But, that will be later. Let's see, more questions?</span> <span m='717000'>No?\
  \ OK, so let's see,</span> <span m='723000'>so how are we going to actually prove\
  \ this theorem?</span> <span m='732000'>Well, if you remember how we prove Green's\
  \ theorem a while</span> <span m='735000'>ago, the answer is we're going to do it\
  \ exactly the same way.</span> <span m='738000'>So, if you don't remember, then\
  \ I'm going to explain.</span> <span m='742000'>OK, so the first thing we need to\
  \ do is actually a</span> <span m='744000'>simplification. So, instead of proving\
  \ the</span> <span m='748000'>divergence theorem, namely, the equality up there,</span>\
  \ <span m='753000'>I'm going to actually prove something easier.</span> <span m='758000'>I'm\
  \ going to prove that the flux of a vector field that has</span> <span m='764000'>only\
  \ a z component is actually equal to the triple integral of,</span> <span m='772000'>well,\
  \ the divergence of this is just R sub z dV.</span> <span m='778000'>OK, now, how\
  \ do I go back to the general case?</span> <span m='780000'>Well, I will just prove\
  \ the same thing for a vector field</span> <span m='783000'>that has only an x component\
  \ or only a y component.</span> <span m='787000'>And then, I will add these things\
  \ together.</span> <span m='790000'>So, if you think carefully about what happens\
  \ when you</span> <span m='792000'>evaluate this, you will have some formula for</span>\
  \ <span m='795000'>ndS, and when you do the dot</span> <span m='796000'>product,\
  \ you'll end up with the sum,</span> <span m='798000'>P times something plus Q times\
  \ something plus R times</span> <span m='801000'>something. And basically,</span>\
  \ <span m='802000'>we are just dealing with the last term, R times something,</span>\
  \ <span m='806000'>and showing that it's equal to what it should be.</span> <span\
  \ m='808000'>And then, we the three such terms together.</span> <span m='810000'>We'll\
  \ get the general case. OK, so then we get the general</span> <span m='824000'>case\
  \ by summing one such identity for each component.</span> <span m='841000'>I should\
  \ say three such identities, one for each</span> <span m='848000'>component, whatever.\
  \ Now, let's make a second</span> <span m='853000'>simplification because I'm still\
  \ not feeling confident I can</span> <span m='857000'>prove this right away for\
  \ any surface.</span> <span m='859000'>I'm going to do it first or what's called\
  \ a vertically</span> <span m='863000'>simple region. OK, so vertically simple means</span>\
  \ <span m='866000'>it will be something which I can setup an integral over the z</span>\
  \ <span m='870000'>variable first easily. So, it's something that has a</span> <span\
  \ m='876000'>bottom face, and a top face, and then some vertical sides.</span> <span\
  \ m='884000'>OK, so let's say first what happens if the given region,</span> <span\
  \ m='893000'>D, is vertically simple. So, vertically simple means it</span> <span\
  \ m='902000'>looks like this. It has top.</span> <span m='909000'>It has a bottom.\
  \ And, it has some vertical sides.</span> <span m='916000'>So, if you want, if I\
  \ look at it from above,</span> <span m='920000'>it projects to some region in the\
  \ xy plane.</span> <span m='925000'>Let's call that R. And, it lives between the\
  \ top</span> <span m='930000'>face and the bottom face. Let's say the top face is\
  \ z</span> <span m='934000'>equals z2 of (x, y).</span> <span m='937000'>Let's say\
  \ the bottom face is z equals z1(x, y).</span> <span m='942000'>OK, and I don't\
  \ need to know actual formulas.</span> <span m='944000'>I'm just going to work with\
  \ these and prove things</span> <span m='947000'>independently of what the formulas\
  \ will be for these</span> <span m='950000'>functions. OK, so anyway,</span> <span\
  \ m='952000'>a vertically simple region is something that lives above a</span> <span\
  \ m='956000'>part of the xy plane, and is between two graphs of</span> <span m='959000'>two\
  \ functions. So, let's see what we can do in</span> <span m='963000'>that case.\
  \ So, the right-hand side of this</span> <span m='970000'>equality, so that's the\
  \ triple integral, let's start computing</span> <span m='980000'>it. OK, so of course\
  \ we will not be</span> <span m='983000'>able to get a number out of it because\
  \ we don't know,</span> <span m='986000'>actually, formulas for anything.</span>\
  \ <span m='988000'>But at least we can start simplifying because the way this</span>\
  \ <span m='992000'>region looks like, I should say this is D,</span> <span m='996000'>tells\
  \ me that I can start setting up the triple integral</span> <span m='1000000'>at\
  \ least in the order where I integrate first over z.</span> <span m='1005000'>OK,\
  \ so I can actually do it as a triple integral with Rz dz</span> <span m='1013000'>dxdy\
  \ or dydx, doesn't matter.</span> <span m='1017000'>So, what are the bounds on z?\
  \ See, this is actually good</span> <span m='1021000'>practice to remember how we\
  \ set up triple integrals.</span> <span m='1024000'>So, remember, when we did it\
  \ first over z,</span> <span m='1026000'>we start by fixing a point, x and y,</span>\
  \ <span m='1029000'>and for that value of x and y, we look at a small vertical</span>\
  \ <span m='1032000'>slice and see from where to where we have to go.</span> <span\
  \ m='1036000'>Well, we start at z equals whatever the value is at the</span> <span\
  \ m='1041000'>bottom, so, z1 of x and y. And, we go up to the top face,</span> <span\
  \ m='1048000'>z2 of x and y. Now, for x and y,</span> <span m='1052000'>I'm not\
  \ going to actually set up bounds because I've already</span> <span m='1057000'>called\
  \ R the quantity that I'm integrating.</span> <span m='1061000'>So let me change\
  \ this to, let's say, U or something like</span> <span m='1065000'>that. If you\
  \ already have an R,</span> <span m='1067000'>I mean, there's not much risk for\
  \ confusion,</span> <span m='1069000'>but still. OK, so we're going to call U</span>\
  \ <span m='1073000'>the shadow of my region instead. So, now I want to integrate</span>\
  \ <span m='1079000'>over all values of x and y that are in the shadow of my region.</span>\
  \ <span m='1081000'>That means it's a double integral over this region,</span> <span\
  \ m='1084000'>U, which I haven't described to you.</span> <span m='1086000'>So,\
  \ I can't actually set up bounds for x and y.</span> <span m='1089000'>But, I'm\
  \ going to just leave it like this.</span> <span m='1092000'>OK, now you see,</span>\
  \ <span m='1096000'>if you look at how you would start evaluating this,</span> <span\
  \ m='1099000'>well, the inner integral certainly is not scary because</span> <span\
  \ m='1102000'>you're integrating the derivative of R with respect to</span> <span\
  \ m='1105000'>z, integrating that with respect</span> <span m='1107000'>to z. So,\
  \ you should get R back.</span> <span m='1113000'>OK, so triple integral over D\
  \ of Rz dV becomes,</span> <span m='1119000'>well, we'll have a double integral\
  \ over U of,</span> <span m='1122000'>so, the inner integral becomes R at the point\
  \ on the top.</span> <span m='1129000'>So, that means, remember, R is a function\
  \ of x,</span> <span m='1133000'>y, and z. And, in fact,</span> <span m='1136000'>I\
  \ will plug into it the value of z at the top,</span> <span m='1143000'>so, z of\
  \ xy minus the value of R at the point on the bottom,</span> <span m='1153000'>x,\
  \ y, z1 of x, y.</span> <span m='1156000'>OK, any questions about this? No?</span>\
  \ <span m='1166000'>Is it looking vaguely believable?</span> <span m='1169000'>Yeah?\
  \ OK. So, now, let's compute the</span> <span m='1172000'>other side because here\
  \ we are stuck.</span> <span m='1174000'>We won't be able to do anything else.</span>\
  \ <span m='1176000'>So, let's look at the flux integral.</span> <span m='1179000'>OK,\
  \ we have to look at the flux of this vector field through the</span> <span m='1183000'>entire\
  \ surface, S, which is the whole boundary</span> <span m='1186000'>of D. So, that\
  \ consists of a lot of</span> <span m='1191000'>pieces, namely the top, bottom,\
  \ and the sides.</span> <span m='1196000'>OK, so the other side -- So, let me just\
  \ remind you,</span> <span m='1204000'>S is bottom plus top plus side of this vector\
  \ field,</span> <span m='1212000'>dot ndS equals, OK, so what do we have?</span>\
  \ <span m='1219000'>So first, we have to look at the bottom.</span> <span m='1221000'>No,\
  \ let's start with the top actually.</span> <span m='1223000'>Sorry. OK, so let's\
  \ start with the top.</span> <span m='1235000'>So, just remind you, let's do all\
  \ of them.</span> <span m='1243000'>So, let's look at the top first. So, we need\
  \ to set up the flux</span> <span m='1250000'>integral for a vector field dot ndS.</span>\
  \ <span m='1252000'>We need to know what ndS is. Well, fortunately for us,</span>\
  \ <span m='1256000'>we know that the top face is going to be the graph of some</span>\
  \ <span m='1259000'>function of x and y. So, we've seen a formula for</span> <span\
  \ m='1263000'>ndS in this kind of situation, OK?</span> <span m='1266000'>We have\
  \ seen that ndS, sorry, so, just to remind you</span> <span m='1271000'>this is\
  \ the graph of a function z equals z2 of x,</span> <span m='1276000'>y. So, we've\
  \ seen ndS for that is</span> <span m='1281000'>negative partial derivative of this\
  \ function with respect to x,</span> <span m='1290000'>negative partial z2 with\
  \ respect to y,</span> <span m='1295000'>one, dxdy. OK, and, well,</span> <span\
  \ m='1298000'>we can't compute these guys, but it's not a big deal because</span>\
  \ <span m='1304000'>if we do the dot product with</span> <span m='1308000'>dot ndS,\
  \ that will give us,</span> <span m='1311000'>well, if you dot this with zero, zero,\
  \ R,</span> <span m='1313000'>these terms go away. You just have R dxdy.</span>\
  \ <span m='1323000'>So, that means that the double integral for flux through the</span>\
  \ <span m='1331000'>top of R vector field dot ndS becomes double integral of the</span>\
  \ <span m='1339000'>top of R dxdy. Now, how do we evaluate that,</span> <span m='1343000'>actually?\
  \ Well, so R is a function of x,</span> <span m='1348000'>y, z. But we said,</span>\
  \ <span m='1349000'>we have only two variables that we're going to use.</span> <span\
  \ m='1352000'>We're going to use x and y. We're going to get rid of z.</span> <span\
  \ m='1355000'>How do we get rid of z? Well, if we are on the top</span> <span m='1358000'>surface,\
  \ z is given by this formula, z2 of x,</span> <span m='1361000'>y. So, I plug z\
  \ equals z2 of x,</span> <span m='1365000'>y into the formula for R, whatever it\
  \ may be.</span> <span m='1370000'>Then, I integrate dxdy. And, what's the range\
  \ for x and</span> <span m='1374000'>y? Well, my surface sits exactly</span> <span\
  \ m='1377000'>above this region U in the xy plane.</span> <span m='1381000'>So,\
  \ it's double integral over U, OK?</span> <span m='1388000'>Any questions about\
  \ how I set up this flux integral?</span> <span m='1397000'>No? OK, let me close\
  \ the door,</span> <span m='1401000'>actually. OK, so we've got one of the two</span>\
  \ <span m='1406000'>terms that we had over there. Let's try to get the others.</span>\
  \ <span m='1424000'>[LAUGHTER] No comment. OK, so, we need to look,</span> <span\
  \ m='1429000'>also, at the other parts of our surface for the flux integral.</span>\
  \ <span m='1436000'>So, the bottom, well, it will work pretty much</span> <span\
  \ m='1440000'>the same way, right, because it's the graph</span> <span m='1443000'>of\
  \ a function, z equals z1 of x,</span> <span m='1446000'>y. So, we should be able\
  \ to get</span> <span m='1450000'>ndS using the same method, negative partial with\
  \ respect</span> <span m='1457000'>to x, negative partial with respect to y,</span>\
  \ <span m='1463000'>one dxdy. Now, there's a small catch.</span> <span m='1466000'>OK,\
  \ we have to think of it carefully about orientations.</span> <span m='1470000'>So,\
  \ remember, when we set up the</span> <span m='1474000'>divergence theorem, we need\
  \ the normal vectors to</span> <span m='1478000'>point out of our region, which\
  \ means that on the top</span> <span m='1482000'>surface, we want n pointing up.</span>\
  \ <span m='1486000'>But, on the bottom face, we want n pointing down.</span> <span\
  \ m='1490000'>So, in fact, we shouldn't use this formula</span> <span m='1492000'>here\
  \ because that one corresponds to the other</span> <span m='1495000'>orientation.\
  \ Well, we could use it and then</span> <span m='1498000'>subtract, but I was just\
  \ going to say that ndS is actually the</span> <span m='1502000'>opposite of this.\
  \ So, I'm going to switch all my</span> <span m='1506000'>signs. OK, that's the\
  \ other side of</span> <span m='1509000'>the formula when you orient your graph\
  \ with n pointing downwards.</span> <span m='1513000'>Now, if I do things the same\
  \ way as before,</span> <span m='1518000'>I will get that <0,0, R> dot ndS will\
  \ be negative</span> <span m='1524000'>R dxdy. And so,</span> <span m='1527000'>when\
  \ I do the double integral over the bottom,</span> <span m='1534000'>I'm going to\
  \ get the double integral over the bottom of</span> <span m='1539000'>negative R\
  \ dxdy, which, if I try to evaluate</span> <span m='1542000'>that, well, I actually\
  \ will have to</span> <span m='1546000'>integrate. Sorry, first I'll have to</span>\
  \ <span m='1548000'>substitute the value of z. The value of z that I will want</span>\
  \ <span m='1553000'>to plug into R will be given by, now, z1 of x,</span> <span\
  \ m='1557000'>y. And, the bounds of integration</span> <span m='1560000'>will be\
  \ given, again, by the shadow of our</span> <span m='1564000'>surface, which is,\
  \ again, this guy,</span> <span m='1567000'>U. OK, so we seem to be all set,</span>\
  \ <span m='1569000'>except we are still missing one part of our surface,</span>\
  \ <span m='1572000'>S, because we also need to look at the sides.</span> <span m='1574000'>Well,\
  \ what about the sides? Well, our vector field,</span> <span m='1580000'>, is actually\
  \ vertical.</span> <span m='1583000'>It's parallel to the z axis. OK, so my vector\
  \ field does</span> <span m='1589000'>something like this everywhere. And, why that\
  \ makes it very</span> <span m='1595000'>interesting on the top and bottom, that\
  \ means that on the</span> <span m='1598000'>sides, really not much is going on.</span>\
  \ <span m='1600000'>No matter is passing through the vertical sides.</span> <span\
  \ m='1605000'>So, the side -- The sides are vertical.</span> <span m='1617000'>So,\
  \ <0,0, R> is tangent to the side,</span> <span m='1625000'>and therefore, the flux\
  \ through the sides is</span> <span m='1634000'>just going to be zero. OK, no calculation\
  \ needed.</span> <span m='1643000'>That's because, of course, that's the reason\
  \ why a</span> <span m='1646000'>simplified first things so that my vector field\
  \ would only have</span> <span m='1651000'>a z component, well, not just that but\
  \ that's</span> <span m='1655000'>the main place where it becomes very useful.</span>\
  \ <span m='1659000'>So, now, if I compare my double integral and,</span> <span m='1662000'>sorry,\
  \ my triple integral and my flux integral,</span> <span m='1665000'>I get that they\
  \ are, indeed, the same.</span> <span m='1683000'>Well, that's the statement of\
  \ the theorem we are trying to</span> <span m='1685000'>prove. I shouldn't erase\
  \ it, OK?</span> <span m='1697000'>[LAUGHTER] So, just to recap,</span> <span m='1702000'>we've\
  \ got a formula for the triple integral of R sub z dV.</span> <span m='1712000'>It's\
  \ up there at the very top. And, we got formulas for the</span> <span m='1716000'>flux\
  \ through the top and the bottom, and the sides.</span> <span m='1719000'>And, when\
  \ you add them together,</span> <span m='1721000'>you get indeed the same formula,</span>\
  \ <span m='1727000'>top plus bottom -- -- plus sides of,</span> <span m='1743000'>OK,\
  \ and so we have, actually, completed the proof for this</span> <span m='1748000'>part.\
  \ Now, well, that's only for a</span> <span m='1751000'>vertically simple region,\
  \ OK?</span> <span m='1754000'>So, if D is not vertically simple, what do we do?</span>\
  \ <span m='1764000'>Well, we cut it into vertically simple pieces.</span> <span\
  \ m='1779000'>OK so, concretely, I wanted to integrate over a</span> <span m='1784000'>solid\
  \ doughnut. Then, that's not vertically</span> <span m='1788000'>simple because\
  \ here in the middle, I have not only does top</span> <span m='1792000'>in this\
  \ bottom, but I have this middle face.</span> <span m='1796000'>So, the way I would\
  \ cut my doughnut would be probably I</span> <span m='1799000'>would slice it not\
  \ in the way that you'd usually slice the</span> <span m='1803000'>doughnut or a\
  \ bagel, but at it's probably more</span> <span m='1806000'>spectacular if you think\
  \ that it's a bagel.</span> <span m='1809000'>Then, a mathematician's way of slicing\
  \ it is like this into</span> <span m='1815000'>five pieces, OK? And, that's not\
  \ very convenient</span> <span m='1817000'>for eating, but that's convenient for</span>\
  \ <span m='1820000'>integrating over it because now each of these pieces has a</span>\
  \ <span m='1824000'>well-defined top and bottom face,</span> <span m='1826000'>and\
  \ of course you've introduced some vertical sides for two</span> <span m='1832000'>reasons.\
  \ One is that we've said the flux</span> <span m='1835000'>through them is zero\
  \ anyway. So, who cares?</span> <span m='1840000'>Why bother? But, also, if you\
  \ sum the flux</span> <span m='1843000'>through the surface of each little piece,</span>\
  \ <span m='1847000'>well, you will see that you will be integrating twice over</span>\
  \ <span m='1850000'>each of these vertical cuts. Once, when you do this piece,</span>\
  \ <span m='1852000'>you will be taking the flux through this red guy with normal</span>\
  \ <span m='1856000'>vector pointing to the right, and once, when you take this</span>\
  \ <span m='1860000'>middle little piece, you will be taking the flux</span> <span\
  \ m='1863000'>through that cut surface again, but now with normal vector</span>\
  \ <span m='1867000'>pointing the other way around. So, in fact,</span> <span m='1869000'>you'll\
  \ be summing the flux through these guys twice with</span> <span m='1872000'>opposite\
  \ orientations. They cancel out.</span> <span m='1875000'>Well, and again, because\
  \ of what you are doing</span> <span m='1878000'>actually, the integral was just\
  \ zero anyway.</span> <span m='1880000'>So, it didn't matter. But, even if it hadn't</span>\
  \ <span m='1885000'>simplified, that would do it for us.</span> <span m='1890000'>OK,\
  \ so that's how we do it with the general region.</span> <span m='1892000'>And then,\
  \ as I said at the beginning,</span> <span m='1894000'>when we can do it for a vector\
  \ field that has only a z</span> <span m='1897000'>component, well, we can also\
  \ do it for a</span> <span m='1899000'>vector field that has only an x or only a\
  \ y component.</span> <span m='1902000'>And then, we sum together and we get the\
  \ general case.</span> <span m='1905000'>So, that's the end of the proof. OK, so\
  \ you see,</span> <span m='1912000'>the idea is really the same as for Green's theorem.</span>\
  \ <span m='1915000'>Yes? Oh, there's only four pieces,</span> <span m='1920000'>thank\
  \ you. Yes, there's three kinds of</span> <span m='1925000'>mathematicians: those\
  \ who know how to count,</span> <span m='1933000'>and those who don't. Well, OK.</span>\
  \ <span m='1950000'>So, OK, now I hope that you can see already the interest of\
  \ this</span> <span m='1954000'>theorem for the divergence theorem for computing\
  \ flux</span> <span m='1958000'>integrals just for the sake of computing flux integrals\
  \ like</span> <span m='1962000'>might happen on the problem set or on the next test.</span>\
  \ <span m='1966000'>But let me tell you also why it's important physically to</span>\
  \ <span m='1969000'>understand equations that had been observed empirically well</span>\
  \ <span m='1974000'>before they were actually understood in terms of how</span>\
  \ <span m='1977000'>things go. So, let's look at something</span> <span m='1983000'>called\
  \ the diffusion equation. So, let me explain to you what</span> <span m='1990000'>it\
  \ does. So, the diffusion equation is</span> <span m='1993000'>something that governs,\
  \ well, what's called diffusion.</span> <span m='1996000'>Diffusion is when you\
  \ have a fluid in which you are</span> <span m='1999000'>introducing some substance,\
  \ and you want to figure out how</span> <span m='2004000'>that thing is going to\
  \ spread out,</span> <span m='2007000'>the technical term is diffuse, into the ambient\
  \ fluid.</span> <span m='2010000'>So, for example, that governs the motion of,</span>\
  \ <span m='2016000'>say, smoke in the air, or if you put dye in the</span> <span\
  \ m='2023000'>solution or things like that. That will tell you,</span> <span m='2029000'>say\
  \ that you drop some ink into a glass of water.</span> <span m='2033000'>Well, you\
  \ can imagine that obviously it will get diluted</span> <span m='2037000'>into there.\
  \ And, that equation will tell</span> <span m='2039000'>you how exactly over time\
  \ this thing is going to spread out and</span> <span m='2044000'>start filling the\
  \ entire glass. So, what's the equation?</span> <span m='2049000'>Well, we need,\
  \ first, to know what the unknown</span> <span m='2052000'>will be. So, it's a partial\
  \ differential</span> <span m='2053000'>equation, OK? So the unknown is a function,</span>\
  \ <span m='2056000'>and the equation will relate the partial derivatives of that</span>\
  \ <span m='2060000'>function to each other. So, u, the unknown,</span> <span m='2066000'>will\
  \ be the concentration at a given point.</span> <span m='2076000'>And, of course,\
  \ that depends on the point where</span> <span m='2078000'>you are. So, that depends\
  \ on x,</span> <span m='2080000'>y, z, the location where you are.</span> <span\
  \ m='2082000'>But, since the goal is also to understand how things spread</span>\
  \ <span m='2085000'>over time, it should also depend on time.</span> <span m='2087000'>Otherwise,\
  \ we're not going to get very far.</span> <span m='2091000'>And, in fact, what the\
  \ equation will give us</span> <span m='2093000'>is the derivative of u with respect\
  \ to t.</span> <span m='2095000'>It will tell us how the concentration at a given\
  \ point</span> <span m='2099000'>varies over time in terms of how the concentration\
  \ varied in</span> <span m='2103000'>space. So, it will relate partial u</span>\
  \ <span m='2106000'>partial t to partial derivatives with respect to x,</span> <span\
  \ m='2110000'>y, and z.</span> <span m='2142000'>[APPLAUSE] OK, [LAUGHTER]</span>\
  \ <span m='2143000'>so what's the equation? The equation is partial u</span> <span\
  \ m='2148000'>partial t equals some constant. Let me call it constant k times</span>\
  \ <span m='2155000'>something I will call del squared u, which is also called</span>\
  \ <span m='2161000'>the Laplacian of u, and what is that?</span> <span m='2165000'>Well,\
  \ that means,</span> <span m='2169000'>OK, so just to scare you, del squared is\
  \ this,</span> <span m='2174000'>which means it's the divergence of gradient u that\
  \ we've used</span> <span m='2180000'>this notation for gradient. OK, so if you\
  \ actually expand</span> <span m='2185000'>it in terms of variables, that becomes\
  \ partial u over</span> <span m='2189000'>partial x squared plus partial squared\
  \ u over partial y squared</span> <span m='2195000'>plus partial squared u over\
  \ partial z squared.</span> <span m='2200000'>OK, so the equation is this equals\
  \ that.</span> <span m='2208000'>OK, so that's a weird looking equation.</span>\
  \ <span m='2211000'>And, I'm going to have to explain to you,</span> <span m='2214000'>where\
  \ does it come from? OK, but before I do that,</span> <span m='2217000'>well, let\
  \ me point out actually that the equation is not just</span> <span m='2222000'>the\
  \ diffusion equation. It's also known as the heat</span> <span m='2230000'>equation.\
  \ And, that's because exactly the</span> <span m='2235000'>same equation governs\
  \ how temperature changes over time</span> <span m='2241000'>when you have, again,\
  \ so, sorry I should have</span> <span m='2245000'>been actually more careful. I\
  \ should have said this is in</span> <span m='2248000'>air that's not moving, OK?</span>\
  \ <span m='2251000'>OK, and same thing with the solution.</span> <span m='2252000'>If\
  \ you drop some ink into your glass of water,</span> <span m='2255000'>well, if\
  \ you start stirring, obviously it will mix much</span> <span m='2258000'>faster\
  \ than if you don't do anything.</span> <span m='2260000'>OK, so that's the case\
  \ where we don't actually,</span> <span m='2263000'>the fluid is not moving. And,\
  \ the heat equation now does</span> <span m='2267000'>the same, but for temperature\
  \ in a fluid that's at rest,</span> <span m='2271000'>that's not moving. It tells\
  \ you how the heat goes</span> <span m='2275000'>from the warmest parts to the coldest\
  \ parts,</span> <span m='2278000'>and eventually temperatures should somehow even\
  \ out.</span> <span m='2283000'>So, in the heat equation, that would just be,</span>\
  \ <span m='2288000'>this u would just measure the temperature for temperature of</span>\
  \ <span m='2295000'>your fluid at a given point. Actually, it doesn't have to be</span>\
  \ <span m='2299000'>a fluid. It could be a solid for that</span> <span m='2303000'>heat\
  \ equation. So, for example,</span> <span m='2306000'>say that you have a big box\
  \ made of metal or something,</span> <span m='2311000'>and you do some heating at\
  \ one side.</span> <span m='2314000'>You want to know how quickly is the other side\
  \ going to get hot?</span> <span m='2318000'>Well, you can use the equation to figure\
  \ out,</span> <span m='2320000'>you know, say that you have a metal bar, and you\
  \ keep one side</span> <span m='2324000'>at 400\uFFFD because it's in your oven.</span>\
  \ <span m='2326000'>How quickly will the other side get warm?</span> <span m='2332000'>OK,\
  \ so it's the same equation for both phenomena even though</span> <span m='2337000'>they\
  \ are, of course, different phenomena.</span> <span m='2340000'>Well, the physical\
  \ reason why they're the same is actually</span> <span m='2342000'>that phenomena\
  \ are different, but not all that much.</span> <span m='2345000'>They involve, actually,\
  \ how the atoms and</span> <span m='2347000'>molecules are actually moving, and\
  \ hitting each other inside</span> <span m='2351000'>this medium. OK, so anyway,</span>\
  \ <span m='2354000'>what's the explanation for this?</span> <span m='2357000'>So,\
  \ to understand the explanation, and given what</span> <span m='2360000'>we've been\
  \ doing, we should have a vector field</span> <span m='2362000'>in there. So, I'm\
  \ going to think of the</span> <span m='2366000'>flow of, well, let's imagine that\
  \ we are doing</span> <span m='2370000'>motion of smoke in air. So, that's the flow\
  \ of the</span> <span m='2375000'>smoke: that means at every point, it's a vector\
  \ whose</span> <span m='2379000'>direction tells me in which direction the smoke\
  \ is actually</span> <span m='2383000'>moving. And, its magnitude tells me how</span>\
  \ <span m='2387000'>fast it's moving, and also what amount of smoke</span> <span\
  \ m='2392000'>is moving. So, there's two things to</span> <span m='2396000'>understand.\
  \ One is how the disparities in</span> <span m='2401000'>the concentration between\
  \ different points causes the flow</span> <span m='2406000'>to be there, how smoke\
  \ will flow from the</span> <span m='2410000'>regions where there's more smoke to\
  \ the regions where there's</span> <span m='2414000'>less smoke. And, that's actually\
  \ physics.</span> <span m='2417000'>But, in a way, it's also common sense.</span>\
  \ <span m='2424000'>So, physics and common sense tell us that the smoke will flow</span>\
  \ <span m='2440000'>from high concentration towards low concentration regions.</span>\
  \ <span m='2456000'>OK, so if we think of this function, U,</span> <span m='2461000'>that\
  \ measures concentration, that means we are always going</span> <span m='2464000'>to\
  \ go in the direction where the concentration decreases the</span> <span m='2467000'>fastest.\
  \ Well, what's that?</span> <span m='2469000'>That's negative the gradient. So,\
  \ F is directed along minus</span> <span m='2485000'>gradient u. Now, how big is\
  \ F going to be?</span> <span m='2492000'>Well, they are, you have to come up with\
  \ some</span> <span m='2495000'>intuition for how the two are related.</span> <span\
  \ m='2499000'>And, the easiest relation I can think of is that they might be</span>\
  \ <span m='2502000'>just proportional. So, the steeper the differences</span> <span\
  \ m='2504000'>in concentration, the faster the flow will be,</span> <span m='2507000'>or\
  \ the more there will be flow. And, if you try to think about</span> <span m='2510000'>it\
  \ as molecules moving in random directions, you will see it</span> <span m='2513000'>makes\
  \ actually complete sense. Anyway, it should be part of</span> <span m='2516000'>your\
  \ physics class, not part of what I'm telling</span> <span m='2520000'>you. So,\
  \ I'm just going to accept</span> <span m='2524000'>that the flow is just proportional\
  \ to the gradient of</span> <span m='2532000'>u. So, if you want,</span> <span m='2533000'>the\
  \ differences between concentrations of different</span> <span m='2536000'>points\
  \ are very small, then the flow will be very</span> <span m='2538000'>gentle. And,\
  \ if on the other hand you</span> <span m='2542000'>have huge disparities, then\
  \ things will try to even</span> <span m='2546000'>out faster. OK, so that's the\
  \ first part.</span> <span m='2551000'>Now, we need to understand the second part,\
  \ which is once we</span> <span m='2555000'>know how flow is going, how does that\
  \ affect the</span> <span m='2558000'>concentration? If smoke is going that way,</span>\
  \ <span m='2560000'>then it means the concentration here should be decreasing.</span>\
  \ <span m='2563000'>And there, it should be increasing.</span> <span m='2565000'>So,\
  \ that's the relation between F and partial u partial t.</span> <span m='2578000'>At\
  \ that part is actually math, namely, the divergence theorem.</span> <span m='2587000'>So,\
  \ let's try to understand that part more carefully.</span> <span m='2599000'>So,\
  \ let's take a small piece of a small region in space,</span> <span m='2605000'>D,\
  \ bounded by a surface, S.</span> <span m='2608000'>So, I want to figure out what's\
  \ going on in here.</span> <span m='2613000'>So, let's look at the flux out of D\
  \ through S.</span> <span m='2622000'>Well, we said that this flux would be given\
  \ by double</span> <span m='2629000'>integral on S of F dot n dS. So, this flux\
  \ measures how much</span> <span m='2638000'>smoke is passing through S per unit\
  \ time.</span> <span m='2645000'>That's the amount of smoke through S per unit time.</span>\
  \ <span m='2654000'>But now, how can I compute that differently?</span> <span m='2659000'>Well,\
  \ I can compute it just by looking at the total amount of</span> <span m='2663000'>smoke\
  \ in this region, and seeing how much it changes.</span> <span m='2666000'>If I'm\
  \ gaining or losing smoke, it means it must be going up</span> <span m='2669000'>there.\
  \ Well, unless I have a smoker in</span> <span m='2672000'>here, but that's not\
  \ part of the data.</span> <span m='2675000'>So, that should be, sorry,</span> <span\
  \ m='2681000'>that's the same thing as the derivative with respect to t of</span>\
  \ <span m='2684000'>the total amount of smoke in the region,</span> <span m='2687000'>which\
  \ is given by the triple integral of u.</span> <span m='2690000'>If I integrate\
  \ the concentration of smoke,</span> <span m='2692000'>which means the amount of\
  \ smoke per unit volume over d,</span> <span m='2696000'>I will get the total amount\
  \ of smoke in d,</span> <span m='2699000'>except, well,</span> <span m='2702000'>let's\
  \ see. This flux is counted positively</span> <span m='2705000'>if we go out of\
  \ d. So, actually,</span> <span m='2707000'>it's minus the derivative. This is the\
  \ amount of smoke</span> <span m='2712000'>that we are losing per unit time.</span>\
  \ <span m='2716000'>OK, so now we are almost there. Well, let me actually --</span>\
  \ <span m='2733000'>Because we know yet another way to compute this guy using the</span>\
  \ <span m='2742000'>divergence theorem. Right, so this part here is</span> <span\
  \ m='2748000'>just common sense and thinking about what it means.</span> <span m='2753000'>The\
  \ divergence theorem tells me this is also equal to the triple</span> <span m='2760000'>integral,\
  \ d, of div f dV. So, what I got is that the</span> <span m='2766000'>triple integral\
  \ over d of div F dV equals this derivative.</span> <span m='2775000'>Well, let's\
  \ think a bit about this derivative so,</span> <span m='2778000'>see, you are integrating\
  \ function over x,</span> <span m='2780000'>y, and z. And then, you are</span> <span\
  \ m='2782000'>differentiating with respect to t.</span> <span m='2784000'>I claim\
  \ that you can actually switch the order in which you do</span> <span m='2788000'>things.\
  \ So, when we think about it,</span> <span m='2790000'>is, here, you are taking\
  \ the total amount of smoke and then</span> <span m='2793000'>see how that changes\
  \ over time. So, you're taking the</span> <span m='2797000'>derivative of the sum\
  \ of all the small amounts of smoke</span> <span m='2800000'>everywhere. Well, that\
  \ will be the sum of</span> <span m='2802000'>the derivatives of the amounts of\
  \ smoke inside each little box.</span> <span m='2807000'>So, we can actually move\
  \ the derivatives into the integral.</span> <span m='2815000'>So, let's see, I said\
  \ minus d dt of triple</span> <span m='2820000'>integral over d udV. And, now I'm\
  \ saying this is the</span> <span m='2827000'>same as the triple integral in d of\
  \ du dt dv.</span> <span m='2834000'>And the reason why this is going to work is\
  \ you should</span> <span m='2839000'>think of it as d dt of a sum of u of some\
  \ values.</span> <span m='2844000'>You plug in the values of your points at that\
  \ given time times</span> <span m='2850000'>the small volume. You sum them,</span>\
  \ <span m='2852000'>and then you take the derivative.</span> <span m='2853000'>And\
  \ now, you see, the derivative of this sum is</span> <span m='2862000'>the sum of\
  \ the derivatives. yi, zi, t, so,</span> <span m='2869000'>if you think about what\
  \ the integral measures,</span> <span m='2873000'>that's actually pretty easy. And\
  \ it's because this variable</span> <span m='2878000'>here is not the same as the\
  \ variables on which we are</span> <span m='2881000'>integrating. That's why we\
  \ can do it.</span> <span m='2883000'>OK, so now, if we have this for any region,\
  \ d.</span> <span m='2893000'>So, we have a function of x, y, z, t, and we have\
  \ another</span> <span m='2898000'>function here. And whenever we integrate them</span>\
  \ <span m='2901000'>anywhere, we get the same answer.</span> <span m='2903000'>Well,\
  \ that must mean they're the same.</span> <span m='2906000'>Just think of what happens\
  \ if you just take d to be a tiny</span> <span m='2909000'>little box. You will\
  \ get roughly the value</span> <span m='2911000'>of div f at that point times the\
  \ volume of the box.</span> <span m='2913000'>Or, you will get roughly the value\
  \ of du dt at that point</span> <span m='2916000'>times the value of a little box.\
  \ So, the values must be the same.</span> <span m='2921000'>Well, let me actually\
  \ explain that a tiny bit better.</span> <span m='2926000'>So, what I get is that\
  \ one over, let me divide by the</span> <span m='2930000'>volume of D, sorry. I\
  \ promise, I'm done in a minute.</span> <span m='2940000'>Is the same thing as one\
  \ over volume D of negative du dt,</span> <span m='2948000'>dV. So, that means the\
  \ average</span> <span m='2950000'>value, OK, maybe that's the best way</span> <span\
  \ m='2952000'>of telling it, the average of div f in D is</span> <span m='2957000'>equal\
  \ to the average of minus partial u partial t in D.</span> <span m='2967000'>And,\
  \ that's true for any region, D, not just for some</span> <span m='2970000'>regions,\
  \ but for, really, any region I can think</span> <span m='2973000'>of. So, the outcome\
  \ is that</span> <span m='2977000'>actually the divergence of f is equal to minus\
  \ du dt.</span> <span m='2983000'>And, that's another way to think about what divergence</span>\
  \ <span m='2987000'>means. The divergence,</span> <span m='2988000'>we said, is\
  \ how much stuff is actually expanding,</span> <span m='2990000'>flowing out. That's\
  \ how much we're losing.</span> <span m='2994000'>And so, now, if you combine this\
  \ with that,</span> <span m='2998000'>you will get that du dt is minus divergence\
  \ f,</span> <span m='3002000'>which is plus K del squared u. OK, so you combine\
  \ this guy</span> <span m='3008000'>with that guy, and you get the diffusion</span>\
  \ <span m='3010000'>equation.</span> </p>"
