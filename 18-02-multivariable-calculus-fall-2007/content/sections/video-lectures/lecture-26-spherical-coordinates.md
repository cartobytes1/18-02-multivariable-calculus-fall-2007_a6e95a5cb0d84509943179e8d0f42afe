  \ at ocw.mit.edu.</span> </p><p><span m='23000'>So, last week we learned how to\
  \ do triple integrals in</span> <span m='27000'>rectangular and cylindrical coordinates.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='31000'>And, now we have to learn about spherical coordinates,</span>\
  \ <span m='41000'>which you will see are a lot of fun.</span> </p><p><span m='49000'>So,\
  \ what's the idea of spherical coordinates?</span> </p><p><span m='53000'>Well,\
  \ you're going to represent a point in space using the</span> <span m='58000'>distance\
  \ to the origin and two angles.</span> </p><p><span m='62000'>So, in a way, you\
  \ can think of these as a</span> <span m='66000'>space analog of polar coordinates\
  \ because you just use</span> <span m='69000'>distance to the origin, and then you\
  \ have to use angles</span> <span m='72000'>to determine in which direction you're\
  \ going.</span> </p><p><span m='75000'>So, somehow they are more polar than cylindrical\
  \ coordinates.</span> </p><p><span m='82000'>So, how do we do that? So, let's say\
  \ that you have a</span> <span m='85000'>point in space at coordinates x, y, z.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='89000'>Then, instead of using x, y, z, you will use,</span> <span\
  \ m='92000'>well, one thing you'll use is the distance from the origin.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='97000'>OK, and that is denoted by the Greek letter which looks like a</span>\
  \ <span m='101000'>curly p, but actually it's the Greek R.</span> </p><p><span m='103000'>So\
  \ -- That's the distance from the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='117000'>And so,\
  \ that can take values anywhere between zero and</span> <span m='122000'>infinity.\
  \ Then, we have to use two other</span> <span m='126000'>angles. And, so for that,</span>\
  \ <span m='129000'>let me actually draw the vertical half plane that</span> <span\
  \ m='136000'>contains our point starting from the z axis.</span> </p><p><span m='142000'>OK,\
  \ so then we have two new angles.</span> </p><p><span m='145000'>Well, one of them\
  \ is not really new.</span> </p><p><span m='147000'>One is new. That's phi is the\
  \ angle</span> <span m='150000'>downwards from the z axis. And the other one,</span>\
  \ <span m='154000'>theta, is the angle counterclockwise from the x</span> <span\
  \ m='159000'>axis. OK, so phi, let me do it better.</span> </p><p><span m='171000'>So,\
  \ there's two ways to draw the letter phi,</span> <span m='174000'>by the way. And,\
  \ I recommend this one</span> <span m='176000'>because it doesn't look like a rho.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='178000'>So, that's easier. That's the angle that you have</span>\
  \ <span m='187000'>to go down from the positive z axis.</span> </p><p><span m='193000'>And,\
  \ so that angle varies from zero</span> <span m='197000'>when you're on the z axis,\
  \ increase to pi over two when</span> <span m='203000'>you are on the xy plane all\
  \ the way to pi or 180\uFFFD when you are</span> <span m='208000'>on the negative\
  \ z axis. It doesn't go beyond that.</span> </p><p><span m='218000'>OK, so -- Phi\
  \ is always between zero and pi.</span> </p><p><span m='224000'>And, finally, the\
  \ last one,</span> <span m='226000'>theta, is just going to be the same as before.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='231000'>So, it's the angle after you project to the xy plane.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='235000'>That's the angle counterclockwise from the x</span> <span\
  \ m='240000'>axis. OK, so that's a little bit</span> <span m='242000'>overwhelming\
  \ not just because of the new letters,</span> <span m='245000'>but also because\
  \ there is a lot of angles in there.</span> </p><p><span m='247000'>So, let me just\
  \ try to, you know, suggest two things</span> <span m='251000'>that might help you\
  \ a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='253000'>So, one is, these are called spherical\
  \ coordinates because if</span> <span m='257000'>you fix the value of rho, then\
  \ you are moving on a sphere</span> <span m='261000'>centered at the origin. OK,\
  \ so let's look at what</span> <span m='267000'>happens on a sphere centered at\
  \ the origin, so,</span> <span m='274000'>with equation rho equals a. Well, then\
  \ phi measures how far</span> <span m='281000'>south you are going, measures the\
  \ distance from the</span> <span m='284000'>North Pole. So,</span> <span m='286000'>if\
  \ you've learned about latitude and longitude in</span> <span m='288000'>geography,\
  \ well, phi and theta you can</span> <span m='291000'>think of as latitude and longitude\
  \ except with slightly</span> <span m='294000'>different conventions. OK, so, phi\
  \ is more or less the</span> <span m='299000'>same thing as latitude in the sense\
  \ that it measures how far</span> <span m='305000'>north or south you are. The only\
  \ difference is in</span> <span m='309000'>geography, latitude is zero on the equator</span>\
  \ <span m='312000'>and becomes something north, something south,</span> <span m='316000'>depending\
  \ on how far you go from the equator.</span> </p><p><span m='318000'>Here, you measure\
  \ a latitude starting from the North Pole</span> <span m='321000'>which is zero,\
  \ increasing all the way to the</span> <span m='324000'>South Pole, which is at\
  \ pi. And, theta or you can think of</span> <span m='329000'>as longitude, which\
  \ measures how far you are</span> <span m='333000'>east or west. So, the Greenwich\
  \ Meridian</span> <span m='336000'>would be here, now, the one on the x axis.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='339000'>That's the one you use as the origin for longitude,</span>\
  \ <span m='346000'>OK? Now, if you don't like</span> <span m='348000'>geography,\
  \ here's another way to think about it.</span> </p><p><span m='351000'>So -- Let's\
  \ start again from cylindrical coordinates,</span> <span m='356000'>which hopefully\
  \ you're kind of comfortable with now.</span> </p><p><span m='362000'>OK, so you\
  \ know about cylindrical coordinates where we</span> <span m='366000'>have the z\
  \ coordinates stay z, and the xy plane we do R and</span> <span m='369000'>theta\
  \ polar coordinates. And now, let's think about what</span> <span m='373000'>happens\
  \ when you look at just one of these vertical planes</span> <span m='378000'>containing\
  \ the z axis. So, you have the z axis,</span> <span m='381000'>and then you have\
  \ the direction away from the z axis,</span> <span m='385000'>which I will call\
  \ r, just because that's what r</span> <span m='389000'>measures. Of course, r goes\
  \ all around</span> <span m='392000'>the z axis, but I'm just doing a slice through\
  \ one of these</span> <span m='395000'>vertical half planes, fixing the value of\
  \ theta.</span> </p><p><span m='399000'>Then, r of course is a polar coordinate\
  \ seen from the point</span> <span m='403000'>of view of the xy plane. But here,\
  \ it looks more like</span> <span m='406000'>you have rectangular coordinates again.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='408000'>So the idea of spherical coordinate is you're going to</span>\
  \ <span m='411000'>polar coordinates again in the rz plane.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='414000'>OK, so if I have a point here, then rho will be the distance</span>\
  \ <span m='421000'>from the origin. And phi will be the angle,</span> <span m='426000'>except\
  \ it's measured from the positive z axis,</span> <span m='430000'>not from the horizontal\
  \ axis. But, the idea in here,</span> <span m='436000'>see, let me put that between\
  \ quotes</span> <span m='438000'>because I'm not sure how correct that is,</span>\
  \ <span m='441000'>but in a way, you can think of this as polar</span> <span m='448000'>coordinates\
  \ in the rz plane. So, in particular,</span> <span m='454000'>that's the key to\
  \ understanding how to switch between spherical</span> <span m='458000'>coordinates\
  \ and cylindrical coordinates,</span> <span m='461000'>and then all the way to x,\
  \ y, z if you want,</span> <span m='464000'>right, because this picture here tells</span>\
  \ <span m='468000'>us how to express z and r in terms of rho and phi.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='473000'>So, let's see how that works. If I project here or here,</span> <span\
  \ m='483000'>so, this line is z. But, it's also rho times cosine</span> <span m='492000'>phi.\
  \ So, I get z equals rho cos phi.</span> </p><p><span m='499000'>And, if I look\
  \ at r, it's the same thing,</span> <span m='501000'>but on the other side. So,\
  \ r will be rho sine phi.</span> </p><p><span m='511000'>OK, so you can use this\
  \ to switch back and forth between</span> <span m='514000'>spherical and cylindrical.\
  \ And of course,</span> <span m='517000'>if you remember what x and y were in terms\
  \ of r and theta,</span> <span m='523000'>you can also keep doing this to figure\
  \ out, oops.</span> </p><p><span m='529000'>So, x is r cos theta. That becomes rho\
  \ sine phi cos</span> <span m='537000'>theta. Y is r sine theta.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='541000'>So, that becomes rho sine phi sine theta.</span> </p><p><span m='546000'>And\
  \ z is rho cos phi. But, basically you don't really</span> <span m='555000'>need\
  \ to remember these formulas as long as you remember how to</span> <span m='559000'>express\
  \ r in terms of rho sine phi,</span> <span m='562000'>and x equals r cos theta.\
  \ So, now, of course,</span> <span m='569000'>we're going to use spherical coordinates\
  \ in situations where</span> <span m='571000'>we have a lot of symmetry, and in\
  \ particular,</span> <span m='573000'>where the z axis plays a special role.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='575000'>Actually, that's the same with cylindrical coordinates.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='578000'>Cylindrical and secure coordinates are set up so that</span>\
  \ <span m='580000'>the z axis plays a special role. So, that means whenever you</span>\
  \ <span m='584000'>have a geometric problem, and you are not told how to</span>\
  \ <span m='587000'>choose your coordinates, it's probably wiser to try to</span>\
  \ <span m='591000'>center things on the z axis. That's where these coordinates</span>\
  \ <span m='597000'>are the best adapted. And,</span> <span m='601000'>in case you\
  \ ever need to switch backwards,</span> <span m='603000'>I just want to point out,\
  \ so, rho is the square root of r</span> <span m='607000'>squared plus z squared,\
  \ which means it's the square</span> <span m='611000'>root of x squared plus y squared\
  \ plus z squared.</span> </p><p><span m='615000'>OK, so that's basically all the\
  \ formulas about spherical</span> <span m='620000'>coordinates. OK, any questions\
  \ about that?</span> </p><p><span m='628000'>OK, let's see, who had seen spherical</span>\
  \ <span m='631000'>coordinates before just to see? OK, that's not very many.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='634000'>So, I'm sure for, one of you saw it twice.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='636000'>That's great. Sorry, oops,</span> <span m='642000'>OK, so let's just\
  \ look quickly at equations of some of the</span> <span m='649000'>things. So, as\
  \ I've said,</span> <span m='654000'>if I set rho equals a, that will be just a\
  \ sphere of</span> <span m='662000'>radius a centered at the origin. More interesting\
  \ things:</span> <span m='671000'>let's say I give you phi equals pi over four.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='674000'>What do you think that looks like?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='678000'>Actually, let's take a quick poll on things.</span> </p><p><span m='689000'>OK,\
  \ yeah, everyone seems to be saying it's a cone,</span> <span m='691000'>and that's\
  \ indeed the correct answer.</span> </p><p><span m='693000'>So, how do we see that?\
  \ Well, remember,</span> <span m='701000'>phi is the angle downward from the z axis.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='704000'>So, let's say that I'm going to look first at what happens\
  \ if</span> <span m='709000'>I'm in the right half of a plane of a blackboard,</span>\
  \ <span m='713000'>so, in the yz plane. Then, phi is the angle downward</span> <span\
  \ m='716000'>from here. So, if I want to get pi over</span> <span m='718000'>four,\
  \ that's 45\uFFFD. That means I'm going to go</span> <span m='721000'>diagonally\
  \ like this. Of course, if I'm in the left</span> <span m='723000'>half of a plane\
  \ of a blackboard, it's going to be the same.</span> </p><p><span m='726000'>I also\
  \ take pi over four. And, I get the other half.</span> </p><p><span m='730000'>And,\
  \ because the equation does not involve theta,</span> <span m='733000'>it's all\
  \ the same if I rotate my vertical plane around the z</span> <span m='737000'>axis.\
  \ So, I get the same picture in</span> <span m='741000'>any of these vertical half\
  \ planes, actually.</span> </p><p><span m='747000'>OK, now, so this is phi equals\
  \ pi over four.</span> </p><p><span m='752000'>And, just in case, to point out to\
  \ you what's</span> <span m='755000'>going on, when phi equals pi over four, cosine\
  \ and sine are</span> <span m='759000'>equal to each other. They are both one over\
  \ root two.</span> </p><p><span m='762000'>So, you can find, again, the equation\
  \ of this</span> <span m='766000'>thing in cylindrical coordinates, which I'll remind</span>\
  \ <span m='771000'>you was z equals r. OK, in general,</span> <span m='774000'>phi\
  \ equals some given number, or z equals some number times</span> <span m='778000'>r.\
  \ That will be a cone centered on</span> <span m='781000'>the z axis. OK, a special\
  \ case:</span> <span m='784000'>what if I say phi equals pi over two?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='787000'>Yeah, it's just going to be the xy plane.</span> </p><p><span m='789000'>OK,\
  \ that's the flattest of all cones.</span> </p><p><span m='793000'>OK, so phi equals\
  \ pi over two is going to be just the xy</span> <span m='800000'>plane. And, in\
  \ general,</span> <span m='802000'>if phi is less than pi over two, then you are\
  \ in the upper</span> <span m='804000'>half space. If phi is more than pi over</span>\
  \ <span m='808000'>two, you'll be in the lower half space.</span> </p><p><span m='812000'>OK,\
  \ so that's pretty much all we need to know at this point.</span> </p><p><span m='816000'>So,\
  \ what's next? Well, remember we were trying</span> <span m='825000'>to do triple\
  \ integrals. So now we're going to triple</span> <span m='832000'>integrals in spherical\
  \ coordinates.</span> </p><p><span m='839000'>And, for that, we first need to understand</span>\
  \ <span m='841000'>what the volume element is. What will be dV?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='846000'>OK, so dV will be something, d rho, d phi,</span> <span m='852000'>d\
  \ theta, or in any order that you want.</span> </p><p><span m='858000'>But, this\
  \ one is usually the most convenient.</span> </p><p><span m='863000'>So, to find\
  \ out what it is, well, we should look at how we</span> <span m='867000'>are going\
  \ to be slicing things now.</span> </p><p><span m='869000'>OK, so if you integrate\
  \ d rho, d phi, d theta,</span> <span m='872000'>it means that you are actually\
  \ slicing your solid into little</span> <span m='877000'>pieces that live, somehow,</span>\
  \ <span m='880000'>if you set an interval of rows, OK,</span> <span m='885000'>sorry,\
  \ maybe I should, so, if you first integrate over</span> <span m='888000'>rho, it\
  \ means that you will actually</span> <span m='891000'>choose first the direction\
  \ from the origin even by phi and</span> <span m='897000'>theta. And, in that direction,</span>\
  \ <span m='900000'>you will try to figure out, how far does your region</span> <span\
  \ m='904000'>extend? And, of course,</span> <span m='907000'>how far that goes might\
  \ depend on phi and theta.</span> </p><p><span m='911000'>Then, you will vary phi.\
  \ So, you have to know,</span> <span m='916000'>for a given value of theta, how\
  \ far down does your solid</span> <span m='921000'>extend? And, finally,</span>\
  \ <span m='922000'>the value of theta will correspond to,</span> <span m='925000'>in\
  \ which directions around the z axis do we go?</span> </p><p><span m='928000'>So,\
  \ we're going to see that in examples.</span> </p><p><span m='931000'>But before\
  \ we can do that, we need to get the volume</span> <span m='934000'>element. So,\
  \ what I would like to</span> <span m='936000'>suggest is that we need to figure\
  \ out,</span> <span m='940000'>what is the volume of a small piece of solid which\
  \ corresponds</span> <span m='946000'>to a certain change, delta rho,</span> <span\
  \ m='949000'>delta phi, and delta theta?</span> </p><p><span m='952000'>So, delta\
  \ rho means that you have two concentric spheres,</span> <span m='956000'>and you\
  \ are looking at a very thin shell in between them.</span> </p><p><span m='961000'>And\
  \ then, you would be looking at a piece of that spherical</span> <span m='965000'>shell\
  \ corresponding to small values of phi and theta.</span> </p><p><span m='968000'>So,\
  \ because I am stretching the limits of my ability to draw on</span> <span m='974000'>the\
  \ board, here's a picture. I'm going to try to reproduce</span> <span m='978000'>on\
  \ the board, but so let's start by looking</span> <span m='981000'>just at what\
  \ happens on the sphere of radius a,</span> <span m='984000'>and let's try to figure\
  \ out the surface area elements on the</span> <span m='988000'>sphere in terms of\
  \ phi and theta.</span> </p><p><span m='990000'>And then, we'll add the rho direction.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='999000'>OK, so -- So, let me say, let's start by</span> <span\
  \ m='1009000'>understanding surface area on a sphere of radius a.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1022000'>So, that means we'll be looking at a little piece of the sphere</span>\
  \ <span m='1032000'>corresponding to angles delta phi and in that direction here</span>\
  \ <span m='1041000'>delta theta. OK, so when you draw a map of</span> <span m='1046000'>the\
  \ world on a globe, that's exactly what the grid</span> <span m='1049000'>lines\
  \ form for you. So, what's the area of this guy?</span> </p><p><span m='1053000'>Well,\
  \ of course, all the sides are curvy.</span> </p><p><span m='1055000'>They are all\
  \ on the sphere. None of them are straight.</span> </p><p><span m='1057000'>But\
  \ still, if it's small enough and it looks like a rectangle,</span> <span m='1061000'>so\
  \ let's just try to figure out, what are the sides of your</span> <span m='1066000'>rectangle?\
  \ OK, so, let's see,</span> <span m='1069000'>well, I think I need to draw a bigger\
  \ picture of this guy.</span> </p><p><span m='1075000'>OK, so this guy, so that's\
  \ a piece of what's</span> <span m='1079000'>called a parallel in geography. That's\
  \ a circle that goes</span> <span m='1085000'>east-west. So now,</span> <span m='1087000'>this\
  \ parallel as a circle of radius,</span> <span m='1090000'>well, the radius is less\
  \ than a because if your vertical is to</span> <span m='1094000'>the North Pole,\
  \ it will be actually much</span> <span m='1097000'>smaller. So, that's why when\
  \ you say</span> <span m='1099000'>you're going around the world it depends on whether\
  \ you do it at</span> <span m='1102000'>the equator or the North Pole. It's much\
  \ easier at the North</span> <span m='1108000'>Pole. So, anyway, this is a piece\
  \ of</span> <span m='1113000'>a circle of radius, well, the radius is what I</span>\
  \ <span m='1120000'>would call r because that's the distance from the z axis.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1129000'>OK, that's actually pretty hard to see now.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1131000'>So if you can see it better on this one, then so this guy here,</span>\
  \ <span m='1138000'>this length is r. And, r is just rho,</span> <span m='1143000'>well,\
  \ what was a times sine phi.</span> </p><p><span m='1147000'>Remember, we have this\
  \ angle phi in here.</span> </p><p><span m='1149000'>I should use some color. It's\
  \ getting very cluttered.</span> </p><p><span m='1154000'>So, we have this phi,\
  \ and so r is going to be rho</span> <span m='1159000'>sine phi. That rho is a.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1161000'>So, let me just put a sine phi. OK, and the corresponding\
  \ angle</span> <span m='1169000'>is going to be measured by theta.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1172000'>So, the length of this is going to be a sine phi delta theta.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1188000'>That's for this side. Now, what about that side,</span>\
  \ <span m='1194000'>the north-south side? Well, if you're moving</span> <span m='1196000'>north-south,\
  \ it's not like east-west.</span> </p><p><span m='1198000'>You always have to go\
  \ all the way from the North Pole to the</span> <span m='1201000'>South Pole. So,\
  \ that's actually a great</span> <span m='1204000'>circle meridian of length, well,\
  \ I mean,</span> <span m='1208000'>well, the radius is the radius of the sphere.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1213000'>Total length is 2pi a. So, this is a piece of a circle</span>\
  \ <span m='1222000'>of radius a. And so, now,</span> <span m='1227000'>the length\
  \ of this one is going to be a delta phi.</span> </p><p><span m='1234000'>OK, so,\
  \ just to recap, this is a sine phi delta theta.</span> </p><p><span m='1241000'>And,\
  \ this guy here is a delta phi.</span> </p><p><span m='1246000'>So, you can't read\
  \ it because it's -- And so,</span> <span m='1259000'>that tells us if I take a\
  \ small piece of the sphere,</span> <span m='1262000'>then its surface area, delta\
  \ s,</span> <span m='1266000'>is going to be approximately a sine phi delta theta\
  \ times a</span> <span m='1275000'>delta phi, which I'm going to rewrite as a</span>\
  \ <span m='1282000'>squared sine phi delta phi delta theta.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1287000'>So, what that means is, say that I want to integrate</span> <span\
  \ m='1291000'>something just on the surface of a sphere.</span> </p><p><span m='1294000'>Well,\
  \ I would use phi and theta as my coordinates.</span> </p><p><span m='1297000'>And\
  \ then, to know how big a piece of a sphere is,</span> <span m='1306000'>I would\
  \ just take a squared sine phi d phi d theta.</span> </p><p><span m='1315000'>OK,\
  \ so that's the surface element in a sphere.</span> </p><p><span m='1319000'>And\
  \ now, what about going back into the third dimension,</span> <span m='1323000'>so,\
  \ adding some depth to these things?</span> </p><p><span m='1325000'>Well, I'm not\
  \ going to try to draw a picture because you've</span> <span m='1330000'>seen that's\
  \ slightly tricky. Well, let me try anyway just</span> <span m='1337000'>you can\
  \ have fun with my completely unreadable diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='1344000'>So\
  \ anyway, if you look at, now, something that's a bit</span> <span m='1348000'>like\
  \ that piece of sphere, but with some thickness to it.</span> </p><p><span m='1353000'>The\
  \ thickness will be delta rho, and so the volume will be</span> <span m='1358000'>roughly\
  \ the area of the thing on the sphere times the thickness.</span> </p><p><span m='1364000'>So,\
  \ I claim that we will get basically the volume element</span> <span m='1368000'>just\
  \ by multiplying things by d rho.</span> </p><p><span m='1371000'>So, let's see\
  \ that. So now, if I have a sphere of</span> <span m='1390000'>radius rho, and another\
  \ one that's slightly bigger of radius</span> <span m='1399000'>rho plus delta rho,\
  \ and then I have a little box in</span> <span m='1407000'>here. Then,</span> <span\
  \ m='1409000'>I know that the volume of this thing will be essentially,</span> <span\
  \ m='1414000'>well, its thickness, the thickness is going to be</span> <span m='1418000'>delta\
  \ rho times the area of its base,</span> <span m='1422000'>although it doesn't really\
  \ matter,</span> <span m='1424000'>which is what we've called delta s.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1428000'>OK, so we will get, sorry, a becomes rho now.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1435000'>Square sine phi, delta rho,</span> <span m='1437000'>delta phi, delta\
  \ theta,</span> <span m='1440000'>and so out of that we get the volume element and\
  \ spherical</span> <span m='1444000'>coordinates, which is rho squared sine phi\
  \ d</span> <span m='1448000'>rho, d phi,</span> <span m='1449000'>d theta. And,\
  \ that's a formula that you</span> <span m='1454000'>should remember. OK, so whenever\
  \ we integrate a</span> <span m='1457000'>function, and we decide to switch to</span>\
  \ <span m='1460000'>spherical coordinates, then dx dy dz or r dr d theta</span>\
  \ <span m='1465000'>dz will become rho squared sine phi d rho d phi d theta.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1473000'>OK, any questions on that? No?</span> </p><p><span m='1480000'>OK,\
  \ so let's -- Let's see how that works.</span> </p><p><span m='1498000'>So, as an\
  \ example, remember at the end of the last</span> <span m='1504000'>lecture, I tried\
  \ to set up an example where we were looking at</span> <span m='1511000'>a sphere\
  \ sliced by a slanted plane.</span> </p><p><span m='1516000'>And now, we're going\
  \ to try to find the volume of that</span> <span m='1520000'>spherical cap again,\
  \ but using spherical coordinates</span> <span m='1523000'>instead. So, I'm going\
  \ to just be</span> <span m='1526000'>smarter than last time. So, last time,</span>\
  \ <span m='1529000'>we had set up these things with a slanted plane that was cutting</span>\
  \ <span m='1533000'>things diagonally. And,</span> <span m='1535000'>if I just want\
  \ to find the volume of this cap,</span> <span m='1537000'>then maybe it makes more\
  \ sense to rotate things so that my</span> <span m='1541000'>plane is actually horizontal,\
  \ and things are going to be</span> <span m='1545000'>centered on the z axis. So,\
  \ in case you see that it's</span> <span m='1549000'>the same, then that's great.\
  \ If not, then it doesn't really</span> <span m='1552000'>matter. You can just think\
  \ of this as a</span> <span m='1555000'>new example. So, I'm going to try to find</span>\
  \ <span m='1561000'>the volume of a portion of the unit sphere -- -- that lies</span>\
  \ <span m='1570000'>above the horizontal plane, z equals one over root two.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1580000'>OK, one over root two was the distance from the origin\
  \ to our</span> <span m='1582000'>slanted plane. So, after you rotate,</span> <span\
  \ m='1584000'>that say you get this value. Anyway, it's not very important.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1588000'>You can just treat that as a good example if you want.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1591000'>OK, so we can compute this in actually pretty much any</span>\
  \ <span m='1596000'>coordinate system. And also, of course,</span> <span m='1599000'>we\
  \ can set up not only the volume, but we can try to find</span> <span m='1602000'>the\
  \ moment of inertia about the central axis,</span> <span m='1604000'>or all sorts\
  \ of things. But, we are just doing the</span> <span m='1607000'>volume for simplicity.\
  \ So, actually,</span> <span m='1609000'>this would go pretty well in cylindrical\
  \ coordinates.</span> </p><p><span m='1612000'>But let's do it in spherical coordinates\
  \ because that's the</span> <span m='1615000'>topic of today. A good exercise:</span>\
  \ <span m='1617000'>do it in cylindrical and see if you get the same thing.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1621000'>So, how do we do that? Well, we have to figure out how</span>\
  \ <span m='1628000'>to set up our triple integral in spherical coordinates.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1634000'>So, remember we'll be integrating one dV.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1638000'>So, dV will become rho squared sign phi d rho d phi d theta.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1648000'>And, now as we start, we're already facing some</span>\
  \ <span m='1652000'>serious problem. We want to set up the bounds</span> <span m='1655000'>for\
  \ rho for a given, phi and theta.</span> </p><p><span m='1657000'>So, that means\
  \ we choose latitude/longitude.</span> </p><p><span m='1659000'>We choose which\
  \ direction we want to aim for,</span> <span m='1662000'>you know, which point of\
  \ the sphere we want to aim at.</span> </p><p><span m='1665000'>And, we are going\
  \ to shoot a ray from the origin towards this</span> <span m='1670000'>point, and\
  \ we want to know what portion of the ray is in our</span> <span m='1675000'>solid.\
  \ So -- We are going to choose a</span> <span m='1683000'>value of phi and theta.\
  \ And, we are going to try to</span> <span m='1691000'>figure out what part of our\
  \ ray is inside this side.</span> </p><p><span m='1696000'>So, what should be clear\
  \ is at which point we leave the solid,</span> <span m='1700000'>right? What's the\
  \ value of rho here?</span> </p><p><span m='1703000'>It's just one. The sphere is\
  \ rho equals one.</span> </p><p><span m='1705000'>That's pretty good. The question\
  \ is,</span> <span m='1709000'>where do we enter the region? So, we enter the region\
  \ when we</span> <span m='1713000'>go through this plane. And, the plane is z equals\
  \ one</span> <span m='1718000'>over root two. So, what does that tell us</span>\
  \ <span m='1721000'>about rho? Well, it tells us,</span> <span m='1724000'>so remember,\
  \ z is rho cosine phi.</span> </p><p><span m='1730000'>So, the plane is z equals\
  \ one over root two.</span> </p><p><span m='1735000'>That means rho cosine phi is\
  \ one over root two.</span> </p><p><span m='1740000'>That means rho equals one over\
  \ root two cosine phi or,</span> <span m='1745000'>as some of you know it, one over\
  \ root two times second</span> <span m='1751000'>phi. OK, so if we want to set up\
  \ the</span> <span m='1757000'>bounds, then we'll start with one over root two second\
  \ phi all</span> <span m='1767000'>the way to one. Now, what's next?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1772000'>Well, so we've done, I think that's basically the</span> <span m='1775000'>hardest\
  \ part of the job. Next, we have to figure out,</span> <span m='1778000'>what's\
  \ the range for phi? So, the range for phi,</span> <span m='1781000'>well, we have\
  \ to figure out how far to the north and to the</span> <span m='1784000'>south our\
  \ region goes. Well, the lower bound for phi</span> <span m='1788000'>is pretty\
  \ easy, right, because we go all the</span> <span m='1791000'>way to the North Pole\
  \ direction. So, phi starts at zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1796000'>The question\
  \ is, where does it stop?</span> </p><p><span m='1799000'>To find out where it stops,\
  \ we have to figure out,</span> <span m='1802000'>what is the value of phi when\
  \ we hit the edge of the region?</span> </p><p><span m='1806000'>OK, so maybe you\
  \ see it. Maybe you don't.</span> </p><p><span m='1810000'>One way to do it geometrically\
  \ is to just, it's always great to</span> <span m='1815000'>draw a slice of your\
  \ region. So, if you slice these things</span> <span m='1819000'>by a vertical plane,\
  \ or actually even better,</span> <span m='1822000'>a vertical half plane, something\
  \ to delete one half of</span> <span m='1825000'>the picture. So, I'm going to draw\
  \ these r</span> <span m='1828000'>and z directions as before. So, my sphere is\
  \ here.</span> </p><p><span m='1833000'>My plane is here at one over root two.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1838000'>And, my solid is here. So now, the question is what is</span>\
  \ <span m='1843000'>the value of phi when I'm going to stop hitting the region?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1849000'>And, if you try to figure out first what is this direction</span>\
  \ <span m='1854000'>here, that's also one over root two.</span> </p><p><span m='1857000'>And\
  \ so, this is actually 45\uFFFD, also known as pi over four.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1863000'>The other way to think about it is at this point,</span> <span m='1869000'>well,\
  \ rho is equal to one because you are on the sphere.</span> </p><p><span m='1876000'>But,\
  \ you are also on the plane. So, rho cos phi is one over</span> <span m='1882000'>root\
  \ two. So, if you plug rho equals one</span> <span m='1886000'>into here, you get\
  \ cos phi equals one over root two which</span> <span m='1891000'>gives you phi\
  \ equals pi over four.</span> </p><p><span m='1894000'>That's the other way to do\
  \ it. You can do it either by</span> <span m='1897000'>calculation or by looking\
  \ at the picture.</span> </p><p><span m='1899000'>OK, so either way, we've decided\
  \ that phi goes</span> <span m='1903000'>from zero to pi over four. So, this is\
  \ pi over four.</span> </p><p><span m='1908000'>Finally, what about theta? Well,\
  \ because we go all around</span> <span m='1914000'>the z axis we are going to go\
  \ just zero to 2pi.</span> </p><p><span m='1920000'>OK, any questions about these\
  \ bounds?</span> </p><p><span m='1926000'>OK, so note how the equation of this horizontal\
  \ plane in</span> <span m='1930000'>spherical coordinates has become a little bit\
  \ weird.</span> </p><p><span m='1933000'>But, if you remember how we do</span> <span\
  \ m='1936000'>things, say that you have a line in</span> <span m='1939000'>polar\
  \ coordinates, and that line does not pass</span> <span m='1941000'>through the\
  \ origin, then you also end up with</span> <span m='1943000'>something like that.\
  \ You get something like r equals</span> <span m='1946000'>a second theta or a cos\
  \ second theta for horizontal or vertical</span> <span m='1951000'>lines. And so,\
  \ it's not surprising you</span> <span m='1953000'>should get this. That's in line\
  \ with the idea</span> <span m='1958000'>that we are just doing again, polar coordinates\
  \ in the rz</span> <span m='1964000'>directions. So of course,</span> <span m='1966000'>in\
  \ general, things can be very messy.</span> </p><p><span m='1968000'>But, generally\
  \ speaking, the kinds of regions that we</span> <span m='1971000'>will be setting\
  \ up things for are no more complicated or no</span> <span m='1975000'>less complicated\
  \ than what we would do in the plane in polar</span> <span m='1979000'>coordinates.\
  \ OK, so there's,</span> <span m='1980000'>you know, a small list of things that\
  \ you should know how</span> <span m='1983000'>to set up. But, you won't have some</span>\
  \ <span m='1987000'>really, really strange thing. Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='1998000'>D\
  \ rho? Oh, you mean the bounds for rho?</span> </p><p><span m='2000000'>Yes. So,\
  \ in the inner integral,</span> <span m='2003000'>we are going to fix values of\
  \ phi and theta.</span> </p><p><span m='2006000'>So, that means we fix in advance\
  \ the direction in which</span> <span m='2009000'>we are going to shoot a ray from\
  \ the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='2011000'>So now, as we shoot this ray, we are\
  \ going to hit our region</span> <span m='2015000'>somewhere. And, we are going\
  \ to exit,</span> <span m='2017000'>again, somewhere else. OK, so first of all we\
  \ have to</span> <span m='2020000'>figure out where we enter, where we leave.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2023000'>Well, we enter when the ray hits the flat face,</span>\
  \ <span m='2026000'>when we hit the plane. And, we would leave when we hit</span>\
  \ <span m='2030000'>the sphere. So, the lower bound will be</span> <span m='2032000'>given\
  \ by the plane. The upper bound will be given</span> <span m='2036000'>by the sphere.\
  \ So now, you have to get</span> <span m='2038000'>spherical coordinate equations\
  \ for both the plane and the</span> <span m='2041000'>sphere. For the sphere, that's\
  \ easy.</span> </p><p><span m='2042000'>That's rho equals one. For the plane,</span>\
  \ <span m='2045000'>you start with z equals one over root two.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2048000'>And, you switch it into spherical coordinates.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2051000'>And then, you solve for rho. And, that's how you get these</span>\
  \ <span m='2054000'>bounds. Is that OK?</span> </p><p><span m='2059000'>All right,\
  \ so that's the setup part.</span> </p><p><span m='2066000'>And, of course, the\
  \ evaluation part goes as</span> <span m='2069000'>usual.</span> </p><p><span m='2082000'>And,\
  \ since I'm running short of time, I'm not going to actually</span> <span m='2086000'>do\
  \ the evaluation. I'm going to let you figure out</span> <span m='2092000'>how it\
  \ goes. Let me just say in case you</span> <span m='2098000'>want to check your\
  \ answers, so, at the end you get 2pi over</span> <span m='2107000'>three minus\
  \ 5pi over six root two.</span> </p><p><span m='2113000'>Yes, it looks quite complicated.\
  \ That's basically because you</span> <span m='2117000'>get one over, well, you\
  \ get a second square</span> <span m='2120000'>when you integrate C. When you integrate\
  \ rho squared,</span> <span m='2123000'>you will get rho cubed over three.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2124000'>But that rho cubed will give you a second cube for the\
  \ lower</span> <span m='2127000'>bound. And, when you integrate sine</span> <span\
  \ m='2129000'>phi second cubed phi, you do a substitution.</span> </p><p><span m='2131000'>You\
  \ see that integrates to one over second squared with a</span> <span m='2137000'>factor\
  \ in front. So, in the second square,</span> <span m='2142000'>when you plug in,\
  \ no, that's not quite all of it.</span> </p><p><span m='2149000'>Yeah, well, the\
  \ second square is one thing,</span> <span m='2151000'>and also the other bound\
  \ you get sine phi which integrates to</span> <span m='2153000'>cosine phi. So,\
  \ anyways,</span> <span m='2156000'>you get lots of things. OK, enough about it.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2164000'>So, next, I have to tell you about applications.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2167000'>And, of course, well, there's the same</span> <span m='2173000'>applications\
  \ that we've seen that last time,</span> <span m='2174000'>finding volumes, finding\
  \ masses,</span> <span m='2176000'>finding average values of functions.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2179000'>In particular, now, we could say to find the</span> <span m='2182000'>average\
  \ distance of a point in this solid to the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='2186000'>Well,\
  \ spherical coordinates become</span> <span m='2188000'>appealing because the function\
  \ you are averaging is just rho</span> <span m='2192000'>while in other coordinate\
  \ systems it's a more complicated</span> <span m='2195000'>function. So, if you\
  \ are asked to find</span> <span m='2197000'>the average distance from the origin,\
  \ spherical coordinates</span> <span m='2201000'>can be interesting. Also,</span>\
  \ <span m='2203000'>well, there's moments of inertia,</span> <span m='2207000'>preferably\
  \ the one about the z axis because if you have to</span> <span m='2210000'>integrate\
  \ something that involves x or y,</span> <span m='2212000'>then your integrand will\
  \ contain that awful rho sine phi</span> <span m='2215000'>sine theta or rho sine\
  \ phi cosine theta,</span> <span m='2217000'>and then it won't be much fun to evaluate.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2220000'>So, that anyway, there's the usual ones.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2225000'>And then there's a new one. So, in physics,</span> <span m='2228000'>you've\
  \ probably seen things about gravitational attraction.</span> </p><p><span m='2236000'>If\
  \ not, well, it's what causes apples to fall</span> <span m='2239000'>and other\
  \ things like that as well.</span> </p><p><span m='2242000'>So, anyway, physics\
  \ tells you that if you have two masses,</span> <span m='2246000'>then they attract\
  \ each other with a force that's directed</span> <span m='2250000'>towards each\
  \ other. And in intensity,</span> <span m='2253000'>it's proportional to the two\
  \ masses, and inversely</span> <span m='2257000'>proportional to the square of the\
  \ distance between them.</span> </p><p><span m='2261000'>So, if you have a given\
  \ solid with</span> <span m='2265000'>a certain mass distribution, and you want\
  \ to know how it</span> <span m='2270000'>attracts something else that you will\
  \ put nearby,</span> <span m='2273000'>then you actually have to, the first approximation\
  \ will be</span> <span m='2278000'>to say, well, let's just put a point</span> <span\
  \ m='2279000'>mass at its center of mass. But, if you're solid is</span> <span m='2282000'>actually\
  \ not homogenous, or has a weird shape,</span> <span m='2284000'>then that's not\
  \ actually the exact answer.</span> </p><p><span m='2287000'>So, in general, you\
  \ would have to just take</span> <span m='2289000'>every single piece of your object\
  \ and figure out how it</span> <span m='2292000'>attracts you, and then compute\
  \ the sum of</span> <span m='2294000'>these. So, for example,</span> <span m='2295000'>if\
  \ you want to understand why anything that you drop in this</span> <span m='2298000'>room\
  \ will fall down, you have to understand that</span> <span m='2301000'>Boston is\
  \ actually attracting it towards Boston.</span> </p><p><span m='2304000'>And, Somerville's\
  \ attracting it towards Somerville,</span> <span m='2306000'>and lots of things\
  \ like that. And, China, which is much</span> <span m='2309000'>further on the other\
  \ side is going to attract towards China.</span> </p><p><span m='2313000'>But, there's\
  \ a lot of stuff on the other side of the Earth.</span> </p><p><span m='2315000'>And\
  \ so, overall, it's supposed to end up just</span> <span m='2317000'>going down.\
  \ OK, so now, how to find this</span> <span m='2321000'>out, well, you have to just\
  \ integrate over the entire Earth.</span> </p><p><span m='2327000'>OK, so let's\
  \ try to see how that goes.</span> </p><p><span m='2332000'>So, the setup that's\
  \ going to be easiest for us to do</span> <span m='2336000'>computations is going\
  \ to be that we are going to be the test mass</span> <span m='2341000'>that's going\
  \ to be falling. And, we are going to put</span> <span m='2344000'>ourselves at\
  \ the origin. And, the solid that's going to</span> <span m='2347000'>attract us\
  \ is going to be wherever we want in space.</span> </p><p><span m='2350000'>You'll\
  \ see, putting yourself at the origin is going to be</span> <span m='2353000'>better.\
  \ Well, you have to put something</span> <span m='2355000'>at the origin. And, the\
  \ one that will stay a</span> <span m='2357000'>point mass, I mean, in my case not\
  \ really a point,</span> <span m='2361000'>but anyway, let's say that I'm a point.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2364000'>And then, I have a solid attracting me.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2367000'>Well, so then if I take a small piece</span> <span m='2372000'>of\
  \ it with the mass delta M, then that portion of the solid</span> <span m='2377000'>exerts\
  \ a force on me, which is going to be directed</span> <span m='2382000'>towards\
  \ it, and we'll have intensity.</span> </p><p><span m='2387000'>So, the gravitational\
  \ force -- -- exerted by the mass delta M</span> <span m='2399000'>at the point\
  \ of x, y, z in space on a mass at the</span> <span m='2409000'>origin. Well, we\
  \ know how to express</span> <span m='2413000'>that. Physics tells us that the</span>\
  \ <span m='2416000'>magnitude of this force is going to be, well, G is just a</span>\
  \ <span m='2421000'>constant. It's the gravitational</span> <span m='2423000'>constant,\
  \ and its value depends on which unit system you use.</span> </p><p><span m='2427000'>Usually\
  \ it's pretty small, times the mass delta M,</span> <span m='2433000'>times the\
  \ test mass little m, divided by the square of the</span> <span m='2439000'>distance.\
  \ And, the distance from U to</span> <span m='2443000'>that thing is conveniently\
  \ called rho since we've been</span> <span m='2448000'>introducing spherical coordinates.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2451000'>So, that's the size, that's the magnitude of the</span>\
  \ <span m='2454000'>force. We also need to know the</span> <span m='2456000'>direction\
  \ of the force. And, the direction is going to</span> <span m='2461000'>be towards\
  \ that point. So, the direction of the force</span> <span m='2467000'>is going to\
  \ be that of x, y, z.</span> </p><p><span m='2471000'>But if I want a unit vector,\
  \ then I should scale this down</span> <span m='2473000'>to length one. So, let\
  \ me divide this by rho</span> <span m='2482000'>to get a unit vector. So, that\
  \ means that the force</span> <span m='2492000'>I'm getting from this guy is actually\
  \ going to be G delta M m</span> <span m='2500000'>over rho cubed times x, y, z.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2504000'>I'm just multiplying the magnitude by the unit vector\
  \ in</span> <span m='2510000'>the correct direction. OK, so now if I have not just</span>\
  \ <span m='2514000'>that little p is delta M, but an entire solid,</span> <span\
  \ m='2516000'>then I have to sum all these guys together.</span> </p><p><span m='2519000'>And,\
  \ I will get the vector that gives me the total force</span> <span m='2524000'>exerted,\
  \ OK? So, of course,</span> <span m='2526000'>there's actually three different calculations\
  \ in one</span> <span m='2529000'>because you have to sum the x components to get\
  \ the x</span> <span m='2532000'>components of a total force. Same with the y,</span>\
  \ <span m='2536000'>and same with the z. So, let me first write down the</span>\
  \ <span m='2548000'>actual formula. So, if you integrate over the</span> <span m='2556000'>entire\
  \ solid, oh, and I have to remind you,</span> <span m='2559000'>well, what's the\
  \ mass, delta M of a small piece of</span> <span m='2562000'>volume delta V? Well,\
  \ it's the density times</span> <span m='2565000'>the volume. So, the mass is going\
  \ to be,</span> <span m='2568000'>sorry, density is delta. There is a lot of Greek\
  \ letters</span> <span m='2574000'>there, times the volume element. So, you will\
  \ get that the force</span> <span m='2584000'>is the triple integral over your solid\
  \ of G m x,</span> <span m='2592000'>y, z over rho cubed, delta dV.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2598000'>Now, two observations about that.</span> </p><p><span m='2601000'>So,\
  \ the first one, well, of course,</span> <span m='2603000'>these are just constants.\
  \ So, they can go out.</span> </p><p><span m='2609000'>The second observation, so\
  \ here, we are integrating a</span> <span m='2611000'>vector quantity. So, what\
  \ does that mean?</span> </p><p><span m='2613000'>I just mean the x component of\
  \ a force is given by integrating</span> <span m='2618000'>G m x over rho cubed\
  \ delta dV. The y components,</span> <span m='2621000'>same thing with y. The z\
  \ components,</span> <span m='2623000'>same thing with z. OK, there's no,</span>\
  \ <span m='2626000'>like, you know, just integrate component by</span> <span m='2631000'>component\
  \ to get each component of the force.</span> </p><p><span m='2636000'>So, now we\
  \ could very well to this in rectangular coordinates</span> <span m='2641000'>if\
  \ we want. But the annoying thing is this</span> <span m='2644000'>rho cubed. Rho\
  \ cubed is going to be x</span> <span m='2646000'>squared plus y squared plus z\
  \ squared to the three halves.</span> </p><p><span m='2650000'>That's not going\
  \ to be a very pleasant thing to integrate.</span> </p><p><span m='2653000'>So,\
  \ it's much better to set up these integrals in spherical</span> <span m='2664000'>coordinates.\
  \ And, if we're going to do it in</span> <span m='2669000'>spherical coordinates,\
  \ then probably we don't want to</span> <span m='2672000'>bother too much with x\
  \ and y components because those would</span> <span m='2674000'>be unpleasant. It\
  \ would give us rho sine phi</span> <span m='2678000'>cos theta or sine theta. So,\
  \ the actual way we will set</span> <span m='2687000'>up things, set things up,\
  \ is to place the solid so that</span> <span m='2697000'>the z axis is an axis of\
  \ symmetry.</span> </p><p><span m='2704000'>And, of course, that only works if the\
  \ solid</span> <span m='2707000'>has some axis of symmetry. Like, if you're trying\
  \ to find</span> <span m='2710000'>the gravitational attraction of the Pyramid of\
  \ Giza,</span> <span m='2713000'>then you won't be able to set up so that it has\
  \ rotation</span> <span m='2716000'>symmetry. Well, that's a tough fact of</span>\
  \ <span m='2718000'>life, and you have to actually do it in x, y,</span> <span m='2721000'>z\
  \ coordinates. But, if at all possible,</span> <span m='2724000'>then you're going\
  \ to place things.</span> </p><p><span m='2727000'>Well, I guess even then, you\
  \ could center it on the z</span> <span m='2730000'>axis. But anyway, so you're\
  \ going to</span> <span m='2732000'>mostly place things so that your solid is actually\
  \ centered on</span> <span m='2737000'>the z-axis. And, what you gain by that is</span>\
  \ <span m='2741000'>that by symmetry, the gravitational force will be</span> <span\
  \ m='2745000'>directed along the z axis. So, you will just have to</span> <span\
  \ m='2752000'>figure out the z component. So, then the force will be</span> <span\
  \ m='2758000'>actually, you know in advance that it will be given by zero,</span>\
  \ <span m='2763000'>zero, and some z component. And then, you just need to</span>\
  \ <span m='2771000'>compute that component. And, that component will be</span> <span\
  \ m='2779000'>just G times m times triple integral of z over rho cubed</span> <span\
  \ m='2787000'>delta dV. OK, so that's the first</span> <span m='2790000'>simplification\
  \ we can try to do. The second thing is,</span> <span m='2795000'>well, we have\
  \ to choose our favorite coordinate system to do</span> <span m='2798000'>this.\
  \ But, I claim that actually</span> <span m='2805000'>spherical coordinates are\
  \ the best -- -- because let's see</span> <span m='2817000'>what happens. So, G\
  \ times mass times triple</span> <span m='2824000'>integral, well, a z in spherical\
  \ coordinates</span> <span m='2829000'>becomes rho cosine phi over rho cubed.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2834000'>Density, well, we can't do anything about</span> <span\
  \ m='2837000'>density. And then, dV becomes rho</span> <span m='2841000'>squared\
  \ sine phi d rho d phi d theta.</span> </p><p><span m='2848000'>Well, so, what happens\
  \ with that?</span> </p><p><span m='2854000'>Well, you see that you have a rho,\
  \ a rho squared,</span> <span m='2857000'>and a rho cubed that cancel each other.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2859000'>So, in fact, it simplifies quite a bit if</span> <span\
  \ m='2862000'>you do it in spherical coordinates.</span> </p><p><span m='2888000'>OK,\
  \ so the z component of the force, sorry,</span> <span m='2892000'>I'm putting a\
  \ z here to remind you it's the z component.</span> </p><p><span m='2898000'>That\
  \ is not a partial derivative, OK?</span> </p><p><span m='2899000'>Don't get things\
  \ mixed up, just the z component of the</span> <span m='2907000'>force becomes Gm\
  \ triple integral of delta cos phi sine phi d rho</span> <span m='2915000'>d phi\
  \ d theta. And, so this thing is not dV,</span> <span m='2920000'>of course. dV\
  \ is much bigger,</span> <span m='2922000'>but we've somehow canceled out most of\
  \ dV with stuff that was</span> <span m='2925000'>in the integrand. And see, that's\
  \ actually</span> <span m='2929000'>suddenly much less scary. OK, so just to give\
  \ you an</span> <span m='2935000'>example of what you can prove it this way, you\
  \ can prove Newton's</span> <span m='2941000'>theorem, which says the following\
  \ thing.</span> </p><p><span m='2946000'>It says the gravitational attraction --\
  \ -- of a spherical</span> <span m='2963000'>planet, I should say with uniform</span>\
  \ <span m='2969000'>density, or actually it's enough for the</span> <span m='2972000'>density\
  \ to depend just on distance to the center.</span> </p><p><span m='2974000'>But\
  \ we just simplify the statement is equal to that of a</span> <span m='2990000'>point\
  \ mass -- -- with the same total mass at its center.</span> </p><p><span m='3005000'>OK,\
  \ so what that means is that, so the way we would set it up</span> <span m='3011000'>is\
  \ u would be sitting here and your planet would be over here.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3018000'>Or, if you're at the surface of it, then of course you just put</span>\
  \ <span m='3021000'>it tangent to the xy plane here. And, you would compute that</span>\
  \ <span m='3025000'>quantity. Computation is a little bit</span> <span m='3027000'>annoying\
  \ if a sphere is sitting up there because,</span> <span m='3030000'>of course, you\
  \ have to find bounds,</span> <span m='3031000'>and that's not going to be very\
  \ pleasant.</span> </p><p><span m='3033000'>The case that we actually know how to\
  \ do fairly well is if you</span> <span m='3037000'>are just at the surface of the\
  \ planet.</span> </p><p><span m='3039000'>But then, what the theorem says is that</span>\
  \ <span m='3041000'>the force that you're going to feel is exactly the same as if</span>\
  \ <span m='3044000'>you removed all of the planet and you just put an equivalent</span>\
  \ <span m='3048000'>point mass here. So, if the earth collapsed to a</span> <span\
  \ m='3050000'>black hole at the center of the earth with the same mass,</span> <span\
  \ m='3053000'>well, you wouldn't notice the difference immediately,</span> <span\
  \ m='3055000'>or, rather, you would, but at least not in terms of</span> <span m='3060000'>your\
  \ weight. OK, that's the end for today.</span> </p><p></p>"
