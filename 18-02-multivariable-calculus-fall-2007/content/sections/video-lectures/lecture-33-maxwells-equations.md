  <span m='23000'>Let's try to discuss a bit how things relate to physics.</span>
  <span m='32000'>There are two main things I want to discuss.</span> <span m='33000'>One
  of them is what curl says about force fields and,</span> <span m='42000'>in particular,a
  nice consequence of that concerning</span> <span m='50000'>gravitational attraction.
  More about curl.</span> <span m='56000'>If we have a velocity field, then we have
  seen that the curl</span> <span m='65000'>measures the rotation affects. More precisely
  curl v measures</span> <span m='76000'>twice the angular velocity, or maybe I should
  say the</span> <span m='85000'>angular velocity vector because it also includes
  the axis of</span> <span m='91000'>rotation. I should say maybe for the</span> <span
  m='98000'>rotation part of a motion. For example,</span> <span m='108000'>just to
  remind you, I mean we have seen this guy a</span> <span m='118000'>couple of times,
  but if I give you a uniform</span> <span m='126000'>rotation motion about the z,
  axes.</span> <span m='134000'>That is a vector field in which the trajectories are
  going to be</span> <span m='139000'>circles centered in the z-axis and our vector
  field is just</span> <span m='143000'>going to be tangent to each of these circles.</span>
  <span m='146000'>And, if you look at it from above, then you will have this</span>
  <span m='155000'>rotation vector field that we have seen many times.</span> <span
  m='162000'>Typically, the velocity vector for this would be minus yi plus</span>
  <span m='168000'>yj times maybe a number that represents how fast we are</span>
  <span m='173000'>spinning, the angular velocity in</span> <span m='176000'>gradients
  per second. And then.</span> <span m='181000'>if you compute the curl of this, you
  will end up with two</span> <span m='186000'>omega times k. Now, the other kinds
  of vector</span> <span m='189000'>fields we have seen physically are force fields.</span>
  <span m='192000'>The question is what does the curl of a force field mean?</span>
  <span m='197000'>What can we say about that? The interpretation is a little</span>
  <span m='204000'>bit less obvious, but let's try to get some idea</span> <span m='214000'>of
  what it might be. I want to remind you that if we</span> <span m='222000'>have a
  solid in a force field, we can measure the torque</span> <span m='227000'>exerted
  by the force on the solid.</span> <span m='231000'>Maybe first I should remind you
  about what torque is in space.</span> <span m='235000'>Let's say that I have a piece
  of solid with a mass,</span> <span m='239000'>delta m for example, and I have a
  force that is</span> <span m='243000'>being exerted to it. Let's say that maybe
  my force</span> <span m='249000'>might be F times delta m. If you think,</span>
  <span m='254000'>for example, a gravitational field.</span> <span m='256000'>The
  gravitational force is actually the gravitational field</span> <span m='260000'>times
  the mass. I mean you can forget delta m</span> <span m='264000'>if you don't like
  it. And let's say that the position</span> <span m='269000'>vector, which should
  be aiming for the origin,</span> <span m='273000'>R is here. And now let's say that
  maybe</span> <span m='277000'>this guy is at the end of some arm or some metal thing
  and I</span> <span m='282000'>want to hold it in place. The force is going to exert
  a</span> <span m='286000'>torque relative to the origin that will try to measure
  how</span> <span m='290000'>much I am trying to swing this guy around the origin.</span>
  <span m='294000'>And, consequently, how much effort I have to exert</span> <span
  m='297000'>if I want to actually maintain its place by just holding it at</span>
  <span m='302000'>the end of the stick here. So the torque is now a vector,</span>
  <span m='312000'>which is just the cross-product of a position vector with a</span>
  <span m='327000'>force. What the torque measures again</span> <span m='331000'>is
  the rotation effects of the force.</span> <span m='333000'>And if you remember the
  principle that the derivative of</span> <span m='339000'>velocity, which is acceleration,</span>
  <span m='342000'>is force divided by mass then the derivative of angular</span>
  <span m='350000'>velocity should be angular acceleration which is related to</span>
  <span m='358000'>the torque per unit mass. To just remind you,</span> <span m='364000'>if
  I look at translation motions,</span> <span m='366000'>say I am just looking at
  the point mass so there are no</span> <span m='373000'>rotation effects then force
  divided by mass is acceleration,</span> <span m='381000'>which is the derivative
  of velocity.</span> <span m='388000'>And so what I am claiming is that for rotation
  effects we</span> <span m='395000'>have a similar law, which maybe you have seen
  in</span> <span m='400000'>8.01. Well, it is one of the</span> <span m='403000'>important
  things of solid mechanics, which is the torque</span> <span m='409000'>of a force
  divided by the moment of inertia.</span> <span m='413000'>I am cheating a little
  bit here. If you can see how I am</span> <span m='417000'>cheating then I am sure
  you know how to state it correctly.</span> <span m='420000'>And if you don't see
  how I am cheating then let's just ignore</span> <span m='426000'>the details. [LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m='429000'>Is angular acceleration. And angular acceleration is the</span>
  <span m='439000'>derivative of angular velocity. If I think of curl as an</span>
  <span m='450000'>operation, which from a velocity field</span> <span m='455000'>gives
  the angular velocity of its rotation effects,</span> <span m='461000'>then you see
  that the curl of an acceleration field gives the</span> <span m='466000'>angular
  acceleration in the rotation part of the</span> <span m='469000'>acceleration effects.
  And, therefore,</span> <span m='473000'>the curl of a force field measures the torque
  per unit</span> <span m='479000'>moment of inertia. It measures how much torque
  its</span> <span m='484000'>force field exerts on a small test solid placed in it.</span>
  <span m='488000'>If you have a small solid somewhere, the curl will just</span>
  <span m='492000'>measure how much your solid starts spinning if you leave it</span>
  <span m='496000'>in this force field. In particular,</span> <span m='498000'>a force
  field with no curl is a force field that does not</span> <span m='502000'>generate
  any rotation motion. That means if you put an object</span> <span m='506000'>in
  there that is completely immobile and you leave it in</span> <span m='509000'>that
  force field, well, of course it might</span> <span m='511000'>accelerate in some
  direction but it won't start spinning.</span> <span m='515000'>While, if you put
  it in there spinning already in some</span> <span m='518000'>direction, it should
  continue to spin in the same way.</span> <span m='521000'>Of course, maybe there
  will be friction and things like that</span> <span m='530000'>which will slow it
  down but this force field is not responsible</span> <span m='538000'>for it. The
  cool consequence of this is</span> <span m='545000'>if a force field F derives from
  a potential -- That is what we</span> <span m='554000'>have seen about conservative
  forces.</span> <span m='560000'>Our main concern so far has been to say if we have
  a</span> <span m='563000'>conservative force field it means that the work of a force</span>
  <span m='566000'>is the change in the energy. And, in particular,</span> <span m='569000'>we
  cannot get energy for free out of it.</span> <span m='572000'>And the change in
  the potential energy is going to be the change</span> <span m='576000'>in kinetic
  energy. You have conservation of energy</span> <span m='580000'>principles. There
  is another thing that we</span> <span m='583000'>know now because if a force derives
  from a potential then</span> <span m='588000'>that means its curl is zero. That
  is the criterion we have</span> <span m='593000'>seen for a vector field to derive
  from a potential.</span> <span m='598000'>And if the curl is zero then it means
  that this force does not</span> <span m='614000'>generate any rotation effects.
  For example,</span> <span m='623000'>if you try to understand where the earth comes
  from,</span> <span m='627000'>well, the earth is spinning on itself as it goes around
  the</span> <span m='632000'>sun. And you might wonder where that</span> <span m='635000'>comes
  from. Is that causes by gravitational</span> <span m='637000'>attraction? And the
  answer is no.</span> <span m='640000'>Gravitational attraction in itself cannot
  cause the earth to</span> <span m='644000'>start spinning faster or slower, at least
  if you assume the</span> <span m='647000'>earth to be a solid, which actually is
  false.</span> <span m='652000'>I mean basically the reason why the earth is spinning
  is because</span> <span m='657000'>it was formed spinning. It didn't start spinning</span>
  <span m='661000'>because of gravitational effects.</span> <span m='663000'>And that
  is a rather deep purely mathematical consequence</span> <span m='668000'>of understanding
  gravitation in this way.</span> <span m='672000'>It is quite spectacular that just
  by abstract thinking we got</span> <span m='676000'>there. What is the truth?</span>
  <span m='677000'>Well, the truth is the earth, the moon and everything is</span>
  <span m='681000'>slightly deformable. And so there is deformation,</span> <span
  m='684000'>friction effects, tidal effects and so on.</span> <span m='686000'>And
  these actually cause rotations to get slightly</span> <span m='689000'>synchronized
  with each other. For example,</span> <span m='692000'>if you want to explain why
  the moon is always showing the same</span> <span m='696000'>face to the earth, why
  the rotation of a moon on</span> <span m='699000'>itself is synchronized with its
  revolution around the earth,</span> <span m='703000'>which is actually explained
  by friction effects over time and</span> <span m='707000'>the gravitational attraction
  of the earth and the moon.</span> <span m='710000'>There is something there, but
  if you took perfectly</span> <span m='719000'>rigid, solid bodies then gravitation
  would never cause</span> <span m='729000'>any rotation effects. Of course that tells
  us that we</span> <span m='735000'>do not know how to answer the question of why
  is the earth</span> <span m='740000'>spinning. That will be left for another</span>
  <span m='742000'>physics class. I don't have a good answer to</span> <span m='751000'>that.
  That was kind of 8.01-ish.</span> <span m='755000'>Let me now move forward to 8.02
  stuff.</span> <span m='760000'>I want to tell you things about electric and magnetic
  fields.</span> <span m='774000'>And, in fact, something that is known as</span>
  <span m='781000'>Maxwell's equations. Just a quick poll.</span> <span m='786000'>How
  many of you have been taking 8.02 or something like</span> <span m='790000'>that?
  OK. That is not very many.</span> <span m='793000'>For most of you this is a preview.</span>
  <span m='795000'>If you have been taking 8.02, have you seen Maxwell's</span> <span
  m='798000'>equations, at least part of them?</span> <span m='800000'>Yeah. OK.</span>
  <span m='802000'>Then I am sure, in that case,</span> <span m='803000'>you know
  better than me what I am going to talk about because I</span> <span m='805000'>am
  not a physicist. But just in case.</span> <span m='810000'>Maxwell's equations govern
  how electric and magnetic fields</span> <span m='815000'>behave, how they are caused
  by electric charges and their</span> <span m='819000'>motions. And, in particular,</span>
  <span m='821000'>they explain a lot of things such as how electric devices</span>
  <span m='825000'>work, but also how electromagnetic waves propagate.</span> <span
  m='829000'>In particular, that explains light and all</span> <span m='834000'>sorts
  of waves. It is thanks to them,</span> <span m='838000'>you know, your cell phone,
  laptops and things like that</span> <span m='842000'>work. Anyway.</span> <span
  m='846000'>Hopefully most of you know that the electric field is a vector</span>
  <span m='851000'>field that basically tells you what kind of force will be</span>
  <span m='854000'>exerted on a charged particle that you put in it.</span> <span
  m='858000'>If you have a particle carrying an electric charge then this</span> <span
  m='863000'>vector field will tell you, basically there will be an</span> <span m='867000'>electric
  force which is the charge times E that will be</span> <span m='871000'>exerted on
  that particle. And that is what is</span> <span m='873000'>responsible, for example,
  for the flow of electrons when</span> <span m='876000'>you have a voltage difference.
  Because classically this guy is</span> <span m='881000'>a gradient of a potential.
  And that potential is just</span> <span m='885000'>electric voltage. The magnetic
  field is a little</span> <span m='890000'>bit harder to think about if you have
  never seen it in physics,</span> <span m='895000'>but it is what is causing, for
  example,</span> <span m='900000'>magnets to work. Well, basically it is a force</span>
  <span m='904000'>that is also expressed in terms of a vector field usually called</span>
  <span m='909000'>B. Some people call it H but I am</span> <span m='912000'>going
  to use B. And that force tends to cause</span> <span m='915000'>it, if you have
  a moving charged particle, to deflect its</span> <span m='920000'>trajectory and
  start rotating in a magnetic field.</span> <span m='924000'>What it does is not
  quite as easy as what an electric field</span> <span m='932000'>does. Just to give
  you formulas,</span> <span m='935000'>the force caused by the electric field is
  the charge</span> <span m='939000'>times the electric field. And the force caused
  by the</span> <span m='943000'>magnetic field, I am never sure about the sign.</span>
  <span m='947000'>Is that the correct sign? Good.</span> <span m='952000'>Now, the
  question is we need to understand how these fields</span> <span m='956000'>themselves
  are caused by the charged particles that are</span> <span m='960000'>placed in them.
  There are various laws in there</span> <span m='963000'>that explain what is going
  on. Let me focus today on the</span> <span m='971000'>electric field. Maxwell's
  equations actually</span> <span m='977000'>tell you about div and curl of these
  fields.</span> <span m='982000'>Let's look at div and curl of the electric field.</span>
  <span m='987000'>The first equation is called the Gauss-Coulomb law.</span> <span
  m='997000'>And it says that the divergence of the electric field is equal</span>
  <span m='1007000'>to, so this is a just a physical</span> <span m='1011000'>constant,
  and what it is equal to depends</span> <span m='1014000'>on what units you are using.
  And this guy rho,</span> <span m='1017000'>well, it is not the same rho as in spherical
  coordinates because</span> <span m='1021000'>physicists somehow pretended they used
  that letter first.</span> <span m='1026000'>It is the electric charge density.</span>
  <span m='1028000'>It is the amount of electric charge per unit volume.</span> <span
  m='1035000'>What this tells you is that divergence of E is caused by the</span>
  <span m='1040000'>presence of electric charge. In particular,</span> <span m='1043000'>if
  you have an empty region of space or a region where nothing</span> <span m='1049000'>has
  electrical charge then E has divergence equal to zero.</span> <span m='1054000'>Now,
  that looks like a very abstract strange equation.</span> <span m='1058000'>I mean
  it is a partial differential equation satisfied</span> <span m='1063000'>by the
  electric field E. And that is not very intuitive</span> <span m='1069000'>in any
  way. What is actually more intuitive</span> <span m='1076000'>is what we get if
  we apply the divergence theorem to this</span> <span m='1085000'>equation. If I
  think now about any closed</span> <span m='1091000'>surface, and I want to think
  about the</span> <span m='1096000'>flux of the electric field out of that surface,</span>
  <span m='1101000'>we haven't really thought about what the flux of a force field</span>
  <span m='1104000'>does. And I don't want to get into</span> <span m='1107000'>that
  because there is no very easy answer in general,</span> <span m='1111000'>but I
  am going to explain soon how this can be useful</span> <span m='1115000'>sometimes.
  Let's say that we want to find</span> <span m='1118000'>the flux of the electric
  field out of a closed surface.</span> <span m='1123000'>Then, by the divergence
  theorem,</span> <span m='1127000'>that is equal to the triple integral of a region
  inside of</span> <span m='1133000'>div E dV, which is by the equation one</span>
  <span m='1137000'>over epsilon zero, that is this constant,</span> <span m='1140000'>times
  the triple integral of rho dV.</span> <span m='1146000'>But now, if I integrate
  the charge density over the entire</span> <span m='1149000'>region, then what I
  will get is</span> <span m='1152000'>actually the total amount of electric charge
  inside the</span> <span m='1157000'>region. That is the electric charge in</span>
  <span m='1168000'>D. This one tells us,</span> <span m='1171000'>in a more concrete
  way, how electric charges placed in</span> <span m='1174000'>here influence the
  electric field around them.</span> <span m='1178000'>In particular, one application
  of that is if</span> <span m='1180000'>you want to study capacitors. Capacitors
  are these things</span> <span m='1183000'>that store energy by basically you have
  two plates,</span> <span m='1186000'>one that contains positive charge and a negative
  charge.</span> <span m='1189000'>Then you have a voltage between these plates.</span>
  <span m='1192000'>And, basically, that can provide electrical</span> <span m='1197000'>energy
  to power maybe an electric circuit.</span> <span m='1203000'>That is not really
  a battery because it doesn't store energy</span> <span m='1206000'>in large enough
  amounts. But, for example,</span> <span m='1208000'>that is why when you switch
  your favorite gadget off it</span> <span m='1211000'>doesn't actually go off immediately
  but somehow you see</span> <span m='1214000'>things dimming progressively. There
  is a capacitor in there.</span> <span m='1218000'>If you want to understand how
  the voltage and the charge</span> <span m='1220000'>relate to each other, the voltage
  is obtained by</span> <span m='1223000'>integrating the electric field from one
  plate to the other</span> <span m='1226000'>plate. And the charges in the plates</span>
  <span m='1229000'>are what causes the electric field between the plates.</span>
  <span m='1234000'>That is how you can get the relation between voltage and</span>
  <span m='1237000'>charge in these guys. That is an example of</span> <span m='1241000'>application
  of that. Now, of course,</span> <span m='1244000'>if you haven't seen any of this
  then maybe it is a little bit</span> <span m='1249000'>esoteric, but that will tell
  you part of what you will see in</span> <span m='1254000'>8.02. Questions?</span>
  <span m='1259000'>I see some confused faces. Well, don't worry.</span> <span m='1267000'>It
  will make sense some day. [LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='1274000'>The next one I want
  to tell you about is Faraday's law.</span> <span m='1283000'>In case you are confused,
  Maxwell's equations,</span> <span m='1285000'>there are four equations in the set
  of Maxwell's equations and</span> <span m='1289000'>most of them don't carry Maxwell's
  name.</span> <span m='1291000'>That is a quirky feature. That one tells you about
  the</span> <span m='1300000'>curl of the electric field. Now, depending on your</span>
  <span m='1304000'>knowledge, you might start telling me that</span> <span m='1306000'>the
  curl of the electric field has to be zero because it is the</span> <span m='1310000'>gradient
  of the electric potential.</span> <span m='1312000'>I told you this stuff about
  voltage.</span> <span m='1314000'>Well, that doesn't account for the fact that sometimes
  you can</span> <span m='1318000'>create voltage out of nowhere using magnetic fields.</span>
  <span m='1322000'>And, in fact, you have a failure of</span> <span m='1325000'>conservativity
  of the electric force if you have a magnetic</span> <span m='1329000'>field. What
  this one says is the curl</span> <span m='1332000'>of E is not zero but rather it
  is the derivative of the</span> <span m='1337000'>magnetic field with respect to
  time.</span> <span m='1341000'>More precisely it tells you that what you might have
  learned</span> <span m='1346000'>about electric fields deriving from electric potential
  becomes</span> <span m='1351000'>false if you have a variable magnetic field.</span>
  <span m='1355000'>And just to tell you again that is a strange partial</span> <span
  m='1361000'>differential equation relating these two vector fields.</span> <span
  m='1367000'>To make sense of it one should use Stokes' theorem.</span> <span m='1371000'>If
  we apply Stokes' theorem to compute the work done by the</span> <span m='1376000'>electric
  field around a closed curve,</span> <span m='1380000'>that means you have a wire
  in there and you want to find the</span> <span m='1384000'>voltage along the wire.
  Now there is a strange thing</span> <span m='1387000'>because classically you would
  say, well, if I just have a wire</span> <span m='1390000'>with nothing in it there
  is no voltage on it.</span> <span m='1393000'>Well, a small change in plans. If
  you actually have a varying</span> <span m='1398000'>magnetic field that passes
  through that wire then that will</span> <span m='1403000'>actually generate voltage
  in it. That is how a transformer works.</span> <span m='1411000'>When you plug your
  laptop into the wall circuit,</span> <span m='1414000'>you don't actually feed it
  directly 110 volts,</span> <span m='1416000'>120 volts or whatever. There is a transformer
  in there.</span> <span m='1420000'>What the transformer does it takes some input
  voltage and</span> <span m='1425000'>passes that through basically a loop of wire.</span>
  <span m='1429000'>Not much seems to be happening. But now you have another loops</span>
  <span m='1433000'>of wire that is intertwined with it.</span> <span m='1436000'>Somehow
  the magnetic field generated by it,</span> <span m='1439000'>and it has to be a
  donating current.</span> <span m='1443000'>The donating current varies over time
  in the first wire.</span> <span m='1446000'>That generates a magnetic field that
  varies over time,</span> <span m='1449000'>so that causes 2B by 2t and that causes
  curl of the electric</span> <span m='1453000'>field. And the curl of the electric</span>
  <span m='1455000'>field will generate voltage between these two guys.</span> <span
  m='1458000'>And that is how a transformer works.</span> <span m='1461000'>It uses
  Stokes' theorem. More precisely,</span> <span m='1465000'>how do we find the voltage
  between these two points?</span> <span m='1468000'>Well, let's close the loop and
  let's try to figure out the</span> <span m='1472000'>voltage inside this loop. To
  find a voltage along a</span> <span m='1477000'>closed curve places in a varying
  magnetic field,</span> <span m='1482000'>we have to do the line integral along a
  closed curve of the</span> <span m='1487000'>electric field. And you should think
  of this as</span> <span m='1491000'>the voltage generated in this circuit.</span>
  <span m='1494000'>That will be the flux for this surface bounded by the curve of</span>
  <span m='1505000'>curl E dot dS. That is what Stokes' theorem</span> <span m='1511000'>says.
  And now if you combine that</span> <span m='1514000'>with Faraday's law you end
  up with the flux trough S of minus</span> <span m='1521000'>dB over dt. And, of
  course, you could take,</span> <span m='1525000'>if your loop doesn't move over
  time,</span> <span m='1527000'>I mean there is a different story if you start somehow</span>
  <span m='1531000'>taking your wire and somehow moving it inside the field.</span>
  <span m='1534000'>But if you don't do that, if it is the field that is</span> <span
  m='1537000'>moving then you just can take the dB by dt outside.</span> <span m='1540000'>But
  let's not bother. Again, what this equation tells</span> <span m='1548000'>you is
  that if the magnetic field changes over time then it</span> <span m='1552000'>creates,
  just out of nowhere, and electric field.</span> <span m='1555000'>And that electric
  field can be used to power up things.</span> <span m='1569000'>I don't really claim
  that I have given you enough details to</span> <span m='1571000'>understand how
  they work, but basically these equations</span> <span m='1575000'>are the heart
  of understanding how things like capacitors and</span> <span m='1580000'>transformers
  work. And they also explain a lot of</span> <span m='1583000'>other things, but
  I will leave that to your</span> <span m='1585000'>physics teachers. Just for completeness,</span>
  <span m='1588000'>I will just give you the last two equations in that.</span> <span
  m='1593000'>I am not even going to try to explain them too much.</span> <span m='1597000'>One
  of them says that the divergence of the magnetic field</span> <span m='1602000'>is
  zero, which somehow is fortunate</span> <span m='1605000'>because otherwise you
  would run into trouble trying to</span> <span m='1609000'>understand surface independence
  when you apply Stokes' theorem</span> <span m='1613000'>in here. And the last one
  tells you how</span> <span m='1618000'>the curl of the magnetic field is caused
  by motion of charged</span> <span m='1624000'>particles. In fact, let's say that
  the</span> <span m='1629000'>curl of B is given by this kind of formula, well,</span>
  <span m='1636000'>J is what is called the vector of current density.</span> <span
  m='1643000'>It measures the flow of electrically charged particles.</span> <span
  m='1650000'>You get this guy when you start taking charged particles,</span> <span
  m='1654000'>like electrons maybe, and moving them around.</span> <span m='1658000'>And,
  of course, that is actually part of how</span> <span m='1660000'>transformers work
  because I have told you running the AC through</span> <span m='1664000'>the first
  loop generates a magnetic field.</span> <span m='1666000'>Well, how does it do that?
  It is thanks to this equation.</span> <span m='1669000'>If you have a current passing
  in the loop that causes a</span> <span m='1672000'>magnetic field and, in turn,
  for the other equation</span> <span m='1674000'>that causes an electric field, which
  in turn causes a current.</span> <span m='1679000'>It is all somehow intertwined
  in a very intricate way and is</span> <span m='1688000'>really remarkable how well
  that works in practice.</span> <span m='1695000'>I think that is basically all I
  wanted to say about 8.02.</span> <span m='1697000'>I don't want to put your physics
  teachers out of a job.</span> <span m='1703000'>[LAUGHTER] If you haven't seen any
  of this</span> <span m='1704000'>before, I understand that this is</span> <span
  m='1706000'>probably not detailed enough to be really understandable,</span> <span
  m='1708000'>but hopefully it will make you a bit curious about that and</span> <span
  m='1712000'>prompt you to take that class someday and maybe even remember</span>
  <span m='1716000'>how it relates to 18.02.</span> </p>
