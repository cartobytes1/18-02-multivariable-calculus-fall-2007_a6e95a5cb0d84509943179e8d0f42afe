  the questions of planes</span> <span m=''28000''>and how to think of 3x3 linear
  systems in terms of</span> <span m=''33000''>intersections of planes and how to
  think about them</span> <span m=''38000''>geometrically. And, that in particular
  led us</span> <span m=''42000''>to see which cases actually we don''t have a unique
  solution to</span> <span m=''47000''>the system, but maybe we have no solutions</span>
  <span m=''49000''>or infinitely many solutions because maybe the line at</span>
  <span m=''53000''>intersection of two of the planes happens to be parallel to</span>
  <span m=''56000''>the other plane. So, today, we''ll start by</span> <span m=''62000''>looking
  at the equations of lines.</span> </p><p><span m=''68000''>And, so in a way it seems
  like something which we''ve already</span> <span m=''78000''>seen last time because
  we have seen that we can think of a line</span> <span m=''88000''>as the intersection
  of two planes.</span> </p><p><span m=''94000''>And, we know what equations of planes
  look like.</span> </p><p><span m=''97000''>So, we could describe a line by two equations
  telling us about</span> <span m=''102000''>the two planes that intersect on the
  line.</span> </p><p><span m=''106000''>But that''s not the most convenient way to
  think about</span> <span m=''108000''>the line usually, though, because when you
  have</span> <span m=''111000''>these two questions, have you solve them?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''113000''>Well, OK, you can, but it takes a bit of effort.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''117000''>So, instead, there is another representation</span> <span
  m=''123000''>of a line. So, if you have a line in</span> <span m=''127000''>space,
  well, you can imagine may be that you have a point on it.</span> </p><p><span m=''132000''>And,
  that point is moving in time.</span> </p><p><span m=''134000''>And, the line is
  the trajectory of a point as time varies.</span> </p><p><span m=''139000''>So, think
  of a line as the trajectory of a moving point.</span> </p><p><span m=''153000''>And,
  so when we think of the trajectory of the moving point,</span> <span m=''164000''>that''s
  called a parametric equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''171000''>OK, so we are going
  to learn about parametric equations of</span> <span m=''181000''>lines. So, let''s
  say for example that</span> <span m=''187000''>we are looking at the line. So, to
  specify a line in space,</span> <span m=''193000''>I can do that by giving you two
  points on the line or by giving</span> <span m=''198000''>you a point and a vector
  parallel to the line.</span> </p><p><span m=''202000''>For example, so let''s say
  I give you two</span> <span m=''208000''>points on the line: (-1,2,2), and the other
  point</span> <span m=''215000''>will be (1,3,-1). So, OK, it''s pretty good</span>
  <span m=''220000''>because we have two points in that line.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''223000''>Now, how do we find all the other points?</span> </p><p><span m=''226000''>Well,
  the other points in between these guys and also on</span> <span m=''230000''>either
  side. Let''s imagine that we have a</span> <span m=''234000''>point that''s moving
  on the line, and at time zero,</span> <span m=''240000''>it''s here at Q0. And,
  in a unit time,</span> <span m=''243000''>I''m not telling you what the unit is.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''245000''>It could be a second. It could be an hour.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''248000''>It could be a year. At t=1, it''s going to be at Q1.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''252000''>And, it moves at a constant speed.</span> </p><p><span m=''254000''>So,
  maybe at time one half, it''s going to be here.</span> </p><p><span m=''257000''>Times
  two, it would be over there.</span> </p><p><span m=''259000''>And, in fact, that
  point didn''t start here.</span> </p><p><span m=''261000''>Maybe it''s always been
  moving on that line.</span> </p><p><span m=''264000''>At time minus two, it was
  down there.</span> </p><p><span m=''269000''>So, let''s say Q(t) is a moving point,
  and at t=0 it''s at Q0.</span> </p><p><span m=''291000''>And, let''s say that it
  moves. Well, we couldn''t make it move</span> <span m=''295000''>in any way we want.
  But, probably the easiest to</span> <span m=''298000''>find, so our role is going
  to find formulas for a position of</span> <span m=''302000''>this moving point in
  terms of t. And, we''ll use that to say,</span> <span m=''306000''>well, any point
  on the line is of</span> <span m=''308000''>this form where you have to plug in
  the current value of t</span> <span m=''312000''>depending on when it''s hit by
  the moving point.</span> </p><p><span m=''316000''>So, perhaps it''s easiest to
  do it if we make it move at a</span> <span m=''324000''>constant speed on the line,
  and that speed is chosen so</span> <span m=''331000''>that at time one, it''s at
  Q1.</span> </p><p><span m=''345000''>So, the question we want to answer is, what
  is the position</span> <span m=''356000''>at time t, so, the point Q(t)?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''363000''>Well, to answer that we have an easy observation,</span>
  <span m=''368000''>which is that the vector from Q0 to Q of t is proportional to</span>
  <span m=''375000''>the vector from Q0 to Q1. And, what''s the proportionality</span>
  <span m=''383000''>factor here? Yeah, it''s exactly t.</span> </p><p><span m=''387000''>At
  time one, Q0 Q is exactly the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''394000''>Maybe I should
  draw another picture again.</span> </p><p><span m=''396000''>I have Q0. I have Q1,
  and after time t,</span> <span m=''403000''>I''m here at Q of t where this vector
  from Q0 Q(t) is actually</span> <span m=''416000''>going to be t times the vector
  Q0 Q1.</span> </p><p><span m=''424000''>So, when t increases, it gets longer and
  longer.</span> </p><p><span m=''429000''>So, does everybody see this now? Is that
  OK?</span> </p><p><span m=''435000''>Any questions about that? Yes?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''444000''>OK, so I will try to avoid using blue.</span> </p><p><span m=''446000''>Thanks
  for, that''s fine. So, OK, I will not use blue</span> <span m=''457000''>anymore.
  OK, well, first let me just</span> <span m=''462000''>make everything white just
  for now.</span> </p><p><span m=''466000''>This is the vector from Q0 to Q(t).</span>
  </p><p><span m=''469000''>This is the point Q(t). OK, is it kind of visible now?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''476000''>OK, thanks for pointing it out. I will switch to brighter</span>
  <span m=''483000''>colors. So, OK, so apart from that,</span> <span m=''489000''>I
  claim now we can find the position of its moving point</span> <span m=''493000''>because,
  well, this vector,</span> <span m=''495000''>Q0Q1 we can find from the coordinates
  of Q0 and Q1.</span> </p><p><span m=''499000''>So, we just subtract the coordinates
  of Q0 from those of</span> <span m=''506000''>Q1 will get that vector Q0 Q1 is</span>
  <span m=''512000''>OK, so, if I look at it,</span> <span m=''516000''>well, so let''s
  call x(t), y(t), and z(t) the coordinates</span> <span m=''524000''>of the point
  that''s moving on the line.</span> </p><p><span m=''530000''>Then we get x of t
  minus, well, actually plus one equals</span> <span m=''540000''>t times two. I''m
  writing the components of</span> <span m=''547000''>Q0Q(t). And here, I''m writing
  t times</span> <span m=''553000''>Q0Q1. y(t) minus two equals t,</span> <span m=''559000''>and
  z(t) minus two equals -3t. So, in other terms,</span> <span m=''568000''>the more
  familiar way that we used to write these equations,</span> <span m=''574000''>let
  me do it that way instead, minus one plus 2t,</span> <span m=''582000''>y(t) = 2
  t, z(t) = 2 - 3t. And, if you prefer,</span> <span m=''593000''>I can just say Q(t)
  is Q0 plus t times vector Q0Q1.</span> </p><p><span m=''602000''>OK, so that''s
  our first parametric equation of a line in</span> <span m=''607000''>this class.
  And, I hope you see it''s not</span> <span m=''610000''>extremely hard. In fact,
  parametric equations</span> <span m=''613000''>of lines always look like that. x,
  y, and z are functions of t</span> <span m=''617000''>but are of the form a constant
  plus a constant times t.</span> </p><p><span m=''622000''>The coefficients of t
  tell us about a vector along the line.</span> </p><p><span m=''626000''>Here, we
  have a vector, Q0Q1, which is .</span> </p><p><span m=''633000''>And, the constant
  terms tell us about where we are at t=0.</span> </p><p><span m=''637000''>If I plug
  t=0 these guys go away, I get minus 1,2,</span> <span m=''641000''>2. That''s my
  starting point.</span> </p><p><span m=''646000''>OK, so, any questions about that?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''659000''>No? OK, so let''s see,</span> <span m=''665000''>now,
  what we can do with these parametric equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''672000''>So,
  one application is to think about the relative position of a</span> <span m=''686000''>line
  and a plane with respect to each other.</span> </p><p><span m=''696000''>So, let''s
  say that we take still the same line up there,</span> <span m=''704000''>and let''s
  consider the plane with the equation x 2y 4z = 7.</span> </p><p><span m=''713000''>OK,
  so I''m giving you this plane.</span> </p><p><span m=''715000''>And, the questions
  that we are going to ask ourselves are,</span> <span m=''718000''>well, does the
  line intersect the plane?</span> </p><p><span m=''720000''>And, where does it intersect
  the plane?</span> </p><p><span m=''742000''>So, let''s start with the first primary
  question that maybe we</span> <span m=''748000''>should try to understand. We have
  these points.</span> </p><p><span m=''752000''>We have this plane, and we have these
  points,</span> <span m=''755000''>Q0 and Q1. I''m going to draw them in</span> <span
  m=''758000''>completely random places. Well, are Q0 and Q1 on the same</span> <span
  m=''762000''>side of a plane or on different sides, on opposite sides of the</span>
  <span m=''767000''>planes? Could it be that maybe one of</span> <span m=''770000''>the
  points is in the plane? So, I think I''m going to let</span> <span m=''779000''>you
  vote on that. So, is that readable?</span> </p><p><span m=''785000''>Is it too small?
  OK, so anyway,</span> <span m=''788000''>the question says, relative to the plane,</span>
  <span m=''792000''>x 2y 4z = 7. This point, Q0 and Q1,</span> <span m=''796000''>are
  they on the same side, on opposite sides,</span> <span m=''802000''>is one of them
  on the plane, or we can''t decide?</span> </p><p><span m=''809000''>OK, that should
  be better. So, I see relatively few</span> <span m=''821000''>answers. OK, it looks
  like also a lot of</span> <span m=''826000''>you have forgotten the cards and, so
  I see people raising two</span> <span m=''831000''>fingers, I see people raising
  three fingers.</span> </p><p><span m=''835000''>And, I see people raising four fingers.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''837000''>I don''t see anyone answering number one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''841000''>So, the general idea seems to be that either they are on</span> <span
  m=''843000''>opposite sides. Maybe one of them is on the</span> <span m=''847000''>plane.
  Well, let''s try to see.</span> </p><p><span m=''850000''>Is one of them on the
  plane? Well, let''s check.</span> </p><p><span m=''854000''>OK, so let''s look at
  the point, sorry.</span> </p><p><span m=''860000''>I have one blackboard to use
  here.</span> </p><p><span m=''865000''>So, I take the point Q0, which is at (-1,2,2).</span>
  </p><p><span m=''871000''>Well, if I plug that into the plane equation,</span> <span
  m=''877000''>so, x 2y 4z will equal minus one plus two times two plus four</span>
  <span m=''884000''>times two. That''s, well,</span> <span m=''888000''>four plus
  eight, 12 minus one,</span> <span m=''892000''>11. That, I think,</span> <span m=''894000''>is
  bigger than seven. OK, so Q0 is not in the plane.</span> </p><p><span m=''901000''>Let''s
  try again with Q1. (1,3, - 1) well,</span> <span m=''907000''>if we plug that into
  x 2y 4z, we''ll have one plus two times</span> <span m=''915000''>three makes seven.
  But, we add four times negative</span> <span m=''920000''>one. We add up with three
  less than</span> <span m=''923000''>seven. Well, that one is not in the</span> <span
  m=''925000''>plane, either. So, I don''t think,</span> <span m=''927000''>actually,
  that the answer should be number three.</span> </p><p><span m=''932000''>So, let''s
  get rid of answer number three.</span> </p><p><span m=''937000''>OK, let''s see,
  in light of this,</span> <span m=''942000''>are you willing to reconsider your answer?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''950000''>OK, so I think now everyone seems to be interested in</span>
  <span m=''953000''>answering number two. And, I would agree with that</span> <span
  m=''957000''>answer. So, let''s think about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''960000''>These
  points are not in the plane, but they are not in the</span> <span m=''962000''>plane
  in different ways. One of them somehow overshoots;</span> <span m=''965000''>we
  get 11. The other one we only get 3.</span> </p><p><span m=''968000''>That''s less
  than seven. If you think about how a plan</span> <span m=''972000''>splits space
  into two half spaces on either side,</span> <span m=''975000''>well, one of them
  is going to be the point where x 2y 4z is</span> <span m=''982000''>less than seven.
  And, the other one will be,</span> <span m=''987000''>so, that''s somehow this side.
  And, that''s where Q1 is.</span> </p><p><span m=''992000''>And, the other side is
  where x 2y 4z is actually bigger than</span> <span m=''1003000''>seven. And, to
  go from one to the</span> <span m=''1007000''>other, well, x 2y 4z needs to go through
  the value seven.</span> </p><p><span m=''1013000''>If you''re moving along any path
  from Q0 to Q1,</span> <span m=''1017000''>this thing will change continuously from
  11 to 3.</span> </p><p><span m=''1022000''>At some time, it has to go through 7.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1025000''>Does that make sense? So, to go from Q0 to Q1 we need</span>
  <span m=''1029000''>to cross P at some place. So, they''re on opposite sides.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1051000''>OK, now that doesn''t quite finish answering the question</span>
  <span m=''1057000''>that we had, which was, where does the line intersect</span>
  <span m=''1063000''>the plane? But, why can''t we do the same</span> <span m=''1066000''>thing?
  Now, we know not only the</span> <span m=''1068000''>points Q0 and Q1, we know actually
  any point on</span> <span m=''1071000''>the line because we have a parametric equation
  up there</span> <span m=''1075000''>telling us, where is the point that''s</span>
  <span m=''1077000''>moving on the line at time t? So, what about the moving</span>
  <span m=''1084000''>point, Q(t)? Well, let''s plug its</span> <span m=''1088000''>coordinates
  into the plane equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1090000''>So, we''ll take x(t)
  2y(t) 4z(t). OK, that''s equal to,</span> <span m=''1104000''>well, (-1 2t) 2( 2
  t) 4( 2 - 3t).</span> </p><p><span m=''1114000''>So, if you simplify this a bit,
  you get 2t 2t -12t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1121000''>That should be -8t. And, the
  constant term is minus</span> <span m=''1126000''>one plus four plus eight is 11.
  OK, and we have to compare that</span> <span m=''1134000''>with seven. OK, the question
  is,</span> <span m=''1137000''>is this ever equal to seven? Well, so, Q(t) is in
  the plane</span> <span m=''1147000''>exactly when -8t 11 equals seven.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1156000''>And, that'' the same. If you manipulate this,</span> <span m=''1160000''>you
  will get t equals one half. In fact, that''s not very</span> <span m=''1167000''>surprising.
  If you look at these values,</span> <span m=''1170000''>11 and three, you see that
  seven is actually</span> <span m=''1172000''>right in between. It''s the average
  of these two</span> <span m=''1175000''>numbers. So, it would make sense that</span>
  <span m=''1179000''>it''s halfway in between Q0 and Q1, but we will get seven.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1184000''>OK, and that at that time, Q at time one half,</span>
  <span m=''1190000''>well, let''s plug the values. So, minus one plus 2t will be</span>
  <span m=''1199000''>zero. Two plus t will be two and a</span> <span m=''1204000''>half
  of five halves, and two minus three halves will</span> <span m=''1211000''>be one
  half, OK? So, this is where the line</span> <span m=''1215000''>intersects the plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1243000''>So, you see that''s actually a pretty easy way of finding
  where</span> <span m=''1247000''>a line on the plane intersects each other.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1249000''>If we can find a parametric equation of a line and an</span>
  <span m=''1252000''>equation of a plane, but we basically just plug one</span> <span
  m=''1255000''>into the other, and see at what time the moving</span> <span m=''1259000''>point
  hits the plane so that we know where this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1264000''>OK,
  other questions about this? Yes?</span> </p><p><span m=''1283000''>Sorry, can you
  say that? Yes, so what if we don''t get a</span> <span m=''1290000''>solution? What
  happens?</span> </p><p><span m=''1292000''>So, indeed our line could have been parallel
  to the plane or</span> <span m=''1296000''>maybe even contained in the plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1298000''>Well, if the line is parallel to the plane then maybe
  what</span> <span m=''1302000''>happens is that what we plug in the positions of
  the moving</span> <span m=''1306000''>point, we actually get something that</span>
  <span m=''1308000''>never equals seven because maybe we get actually a constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1310000''>Say that we had gotten, I don''t know,</span> <span m=''1313000''>13
  all the time. Well, when is 13 equal to seven?</span> </p><p><span m=''1316000''>The
  answer is never. OK, so that''s what would tell</span> <span m=''1319000''>you that
  the line is actually parallel to the plane.</span> </p><p><span m=''1322000''>You
  would not find a solution to the equation that you get at</span> <span m=''1326000''>the
  end. Yes?</span> </p><p><span m=''1333000''>So, if there''s no solution at all to
  the equation that you</span> <span m=''1336000''>get, it means that at no time is
  the traveling point going to be</span> <span m=''1339000''>in the plane. That means
  the line really does</span> <span m=''1342000''>not have the plane ever. So, it
  has to be parallel</span> <span m=''1345000''>outside of it. On the other hand,</span>
  <span m=''1347000''>if a line is inside the plane, then that means that no matter</span>
  <span m=''1350000''>what time you choose, you always get seven.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1353000''>OK, that''s what would happen if a line is in the plane.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1357000''>You always get seven. So, maybe I should write this</span> <span m=''1364000''>down.
  So, if a line is in the plane</span> <span m=''1374000''>then plugging x(t), y(t),
  z(t) into the equation,</span> <span m=''1390000''>we always get, well, here in
  this case seven</span> <span m=''1398000''>or whatever the value should be for the
  plane,</span> <span m=''1402000''>If the line is parallel to the plane -- -- in
  fact,</span> <span m=''1414000''>we, well, get, let''s see, another constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1425000''>So, in fact, you know, when you plug in</span> <span
  m=''1429000''>these things, normally you get a quantity</span> <span m=''1431000''>that''s
  of a form, something times t plus a</span> <span m=''1434000''>constant because
  that''s what you plug into the equation of a</span> <span m=''1437000''>plane. And
  so, in general,</span> <span m=''1439000''>you have an equation of the form, something
  times t plus</span> <span m=''1441000''>something equals something. And, that usually
  has a single</span> <span m=''1445000''>solution. And, the special case is if</span>
  <span m=''1448000''>this coefficient of t turns out to be zero in the end,</span>
  <span m=''1451000''>and that''s actually going to happen,</span> <span m=''1454000''>exactly
  when the line is either parallel or in the plane.</span> </p><p><span m=''1460000''>In
  fact, if you think this through carefully,</span> <span m=''1464000''>the coefficient
  of t that you get here,</span> <span m=''1466000''>see, it''s one times two plus
  two times one plus four times</span> <span m=''1470000''>minus three. It''s the
  dot product between</span> <span m=''1473000''>the normal vector of a plane and
  the vector along the line.</span> </p><p><span m=''1477000''>So, see, this coefficient
  becomes zero exactly when the</span> <span m=''1481000''>line is perpendicular to
  the normal vector.</span> </p><p><span m=''1484000''>That means it''s parallel to
  the plane.</span> </p><p><span m=''1486000''>So, everything makes sense. OK, if
  you''re confused about</span> <span m=''1491000''>what I just said, you can ignore
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1495000''>OK, more questions? No? OK, so if not,</span>
  <span m=''1503000''>let''s move on to linear parametric equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1509000''>So, I hope you''ve seen here that parametric equations are a</span>
  <span m=''1513000''>great way to think about lines. There are also a great way to</span>
  <span m=''1518000''>think about actually any curve, any trajectory that can be</span>
  <span m=''1522000''>traced by a moving point. So -- -- more generally,</span> <span
  m=''1534000''>we can use parametric equations -- -- for arbitrary motions --</span>
  <span m=''1560000''>-- in the plane or in space. So, let''s look at an example.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1575000''>Let''s take, so, it''s a famous curve called a</span>
  <span m=''1580000''>cycloid. A cycloid is something that you</span> <span m=''1583000''>can
  actually see sometimes at night when people are biking If</span> <span m=''1587000''>you
  have something that reflects light on the wheel.</span> </p><p><span m=''1591000''>So,
  let me explain what''s the definition of a cycloid.</span> </p><p><span m=''1625000''>So,
  I should say, I''ve seen a lecture where,</span> <span m=''1627000''>actually, the
  professor had a volunteer on a unicycle to</span> <span m=''1630000''>demonstrate
  how that works. But, I didn''t arrange for that,</span> <span m=''1633000''>so instead
  I will explain it to you using more conventional</span> <span m=''1637000''>means.
  So, let''s say that we have a</span> <span m=''1643000''>wheel that''s rolling on
  a horizontal ground.</span> </p><p><span m=''1651000''>And, as it''s rolling of
  course it''s going to turn.</span> </p><p><span m=''1654000''>So, it''s going to
  move forward to a new position.</span> </p><p><span m=''1660000''>And, now, let''s
  mention that we have a point that''s been painted</span> <span m=''1665000''>red
  on the circumference of the wheel.</span> </p><p><span m=''1667000''>And, initially,
  that point is here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1671000''>So, as the wheel stops rotating,
  well,</span> <span m=''1673000''>of course, it moves forward, and so it turns on
  itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''1677000''>So, that point starts falling back behind
  the point of contact</span> <span m=''1682000''>because the wheel is rotating at
  the same time as it''s moving</span> <span m=''1687000''>forward. And so, the cycloid
  is the</span> <span m=''1692000''>trajectory of this moving point. OK, so the cycloid
  is obtained</span> <span m=''1701000''>by considering, so we have a wheel,</span>
  <span m=''1707000''>let''s say, of radius a. So, this height here is (a)</span>
  <span m=''1718000''>rolling on the floor which is the x axis.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1727000''>And, let''s -- And, we have a point,</span> <span m=''1733000''>P,
  that''s painted on the wheel. Initially, it''s at the origin.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1741000''>But, of course, as time goes by,</span> <span m=''1744000''>it moves
  on the wheel. P is a point on the rim of the</span> <span m=''1753000''>wheel, and
  it starts at the origin.</span> </p><p><span m=''1761000''>So, the question is,
  what happens?</span> </p><p><span m=''1767000''>In particular, can we find the position
  of</span> <span m=''1772000''>this point, x(t), y(t), as a function of time?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1777000''>So, that''s the reason why I have this computer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1782000''>So, I''m not sure it will be very easy to visualize,</span>
  <span m=''1788000''>but so we have a wheel, well, I hope you can vaguely</span>
  <span m=''1794000''>see that there''s a circle that''s moving.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1800000''>The wheel is green here. And, there''s a radius that''s</span> <span
  m=''1805000''>been painted blue in it. And, that radius rotates around</span> <span
  m=''1809000''>the wheel as the wheel is moving forward.</span> </p><p><span m=''1812000''>So,
  now, let''s try to paint, actually, the trajectory of a</span> <span m=''1823000''>point.
  [LAUGHTER]</span> <span m=''1826000''>OK, so that''s what the cycloid looks like.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1830000''>[APPLAUSE] OK, so -- So the cycloid,</span> <span m=''1837000''>well,
  I guess it doesn''t quite look like what I''ve drawn.</span> </p><p><span m=''1847000''>It
  looks like it goes a bit higher up, which will be the</span> <span m=''1852000''>trajectory
  of this red point. And, see, it hits the bottom</span> <span m=''1857000''>once
  in a while. It forms these arches because</span> <span m=''1861000''>when the wheel
  has rotated by a full turn,</span> <span m=''1864000''>then you''re basically back
  at the same situation,</span> <span m=''1867000''>except a bit further along the
  route.</span> </p><p><span m=''1869000''>So, if we do it once more, you see the
  point now is at the</span> <span m=''1873000''>top, and now it''s at the bottom.
  And then we start again.</span> </p><p><span m=''1878000''>It''s at the top, and
  then again at the bottom.</span> </p><p><span m=''1883000''>OK. No.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1900000''>[LAUGHTER] OK, so the question that we</span> <span m=''1908000''>want
  to answer is what is the position x(t),</span> <span m=''1918000''>y(t), of the
  point P? OK, so actually,</span> <span m=''1925000''>I''m writing x(t), y(t).</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1927000''>That means that I have, maybe I''m expressing the</span>
  <span m=''1930000''>position in terms of time. Let''s see, is time going to be</span>
  <span m=''1933000''>a good thing to do? Well, suddenly,</span> <span m=''1935000''>the
  position changes over time. But doesn''t actually matter how</span> <span m=''1940000''>fast
  the wheel is rolling? No, because I can just play the</span> <span m=''1944000''>motion
  fast-forward. The wheel will be going faster,</span> <span m=''1947000''>but the
  trajectory is still the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''1949000''>So, in fact, time
  is not the most relevant</span> <span m=''1952000''>thing here. What matters to
  us now is how</span> <span m=''1956000''>far the wheel has gone. So, we could use
  as a</span> <span m=''1959000''>parameter, for example, the distance by which the
  wheel</span> <span m=''1964000''>has moved. We can do even better because</span>
  <span m=''1966000''>we see that, really, the most complicated thing that</span>
  <span m=''1969000''>happens here is really the rotation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1970000''>So,
  maybe we can actually use the angle by which the wheel has</span> <span m=''1975000''>turned
  to parameterize the motion.</span> </p><p><span m=''1977000''>So, there''s various
  choices. You can choose whichever one</span> <span m=''1982000''>you prefer. But,
  I think here,</span> <span m=''1984000''>we will get the simplest answer if we parameterize
  things by the</span> <span m=''1987000''>angle. So, in fact,</span> <span m=''1990000''>instead
  of t I will be using what''s called theta as a</span> <span m=''2003000''>function
  of the angle, theta, by which the wheel has</span> <span m=''2016000''>rotated.
  So, how are we going to do that?</span> </p><p><span m=''2030000''>Well, because
  we are going to try to use our new knowledge,</span> <span m=''2037000''>let''s
  try to do it using vectors in a smart way.</span> </p><p><span m=''2043000''>So,
  let me draw a picture of the wheel after things have</span> <span m=''2047000''>rotated
  by a certain amount. So, maybe my point,</span> <span m=''2052000''>P, now, is here.
  And, so the wheel has rotated</span> <span m=''2058000''>by this angle here. And,
  I want to find the</span> <span m=''2061000''>position of my point, P, OK?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2063000''>So, the position of this point, P, is going to be the
  same as</span> <span m=''2069000''>knowing the vector OP from the origin to this
  moving point.</span> </p><p><span m=''2075000''>So, I haven''t really simplify the
  problem yet because we don''t</span> <span m=''2079000''>really know about vector
  OP. But, maybe we know about</span> <span m=''2083000''>simpler vectors where some
  will be OP.</span> </p><p><span m=''2087000''>So, let''s see, let''s give names
  to a few of</span> <span m=''2090000''>our points. For example,</span> <span m=''2092000''>let''s
  say that this will be point A.</span> </p><p><span m=''2094000''>A is the point
  where the wheel is touching the road.</span> </p><p><span m=''2098000''>And, B will
  be the center of the wheel.</span> </p><p><span m=''2102000''>Then, it looks like
  maybe I have actually a chance of</span> <span m=''2107000''>understanding vectors
  like maybe OA doesn''t look quite so scary,</span> <span m=''2112000''>or AB doesn''t
  look too bad. BP doesn''t look too bad.</span> </p><p><span m=''2116000''>And, if
  I sum them together, I will obtain OP.</span> </p><p><span m=''2127000''>So, let''s
  do that. So, now we''ve greatly</span> <span m=''2135000''>simplified the problem.
  We had to find one vector that</span> <span m=''2139000''>we didn''t know. Now we
  have to find three</span> <span m=''2142000''>vectors which we don''t know. But,
  you will see each of them</span> <span m=''2147000''>as fairly easy to think about.
  So, let''s see.</span> </p><p><span m=''2150000''>Should we start with vector OA,
  maybe?</span> </p><p><span m=''2156000''>So, OA has two components. One of them
  should be very easy.</span> </p><p><span m=''2164000''>Well, the y component is
  just going to be zero,</span> <span m=''2166000''>OK? It''s directed along the x
  axis.</span> </p><p><span m=''2170000''>What about the x component? So, OA is the
  distance by which</span> <span m=''2175000''>the wheel has traveled to get to its
  current position.</span> </p><p><span m=''2181000''>Yeah. I hear a lot of people
  saying R</span> <span m=''2183000''>theta. Let me actually say a(theta)</span> <span
  m=''2185000''>because I''ve called a the radius of the wheel.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2188000''>So, this distance is a(theta). Why is it a(theta)?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2193000''>Well, that''s because the wheel, well, there''s an assumption</span>
  <span m=''2196000''>which is that the wheel is rolling on something normal like</span>
  <span m=''2198000''>a road, and not on, maybe,</span> <span m=''2200000''>ice, or
  something like that. S So, it''s rolling without</span> <span m=''2205000''>slipping.
  So, that means that this</span> <span m=''2208000''>distance on the road is actually
  equal to the distance here on</span> <span m=''2213000''>the circumference of the
  wheel. This point, P,</span> <span m=''2217000''>was there, and the amount by which
  the things have moved can</span> <span m=''2221000''>be measured either here or
  here. These are the same distances.</span> </p><p><span m=''2226000''>OK, so, that
  makes it a(theta), and maybe I should justify by</span> <span m=''2235000''>saying
  amount by which the wheel has rolled,</span> <span m=''2242000''>has moved, is equal
  to the, so, the distance from O to A is</span> <span m=''2250000''>equal to the
  arc length on the circumference of the circle from</span> <span m=''2257000''>A
  to P. And, you know that if you have</span> <span m=''2260000''>a sector corresponding
  to an angle, theta,</span> <span m=''2262000''>then its length is a times theta,
  provided that,</span> <span m=''2265000''>of course, you express the angel in radians.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2268000''>That''s the reason why we always used radians in math.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2278000''>Now, let''s think about vector AB and vector BP.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2310000''>OK, so AB is pretty easy, right, because it''s pointing</span>
  <span m=''2319000''>straight up, and its length is a.</span> </p><p><span m=''2325000''>So,
  it''s just zero, a. Now, the most serious one we''ve</span> <span m=''2335000''>kept
  for the end. What about vector BP?</span> </p><p><span m=''2340000''>So, vector
  BP, we know two things about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2344000''>We know actually
  its length, so, the magnitude of BP -- --</span> <span m=''2357000''>a. And, we
  know it makes an angle,</span> <span m=''2363000''>theta, with the vertical. So,
  that should let us find its</span> <span m=''2369000''>components. Let''s draw a
  closer picture.</span> </p><p><span m=''2374000''>Now, in the picture I''m going
  to center things at B.</span> </p><p><span m=''2380000''>So, I have my point P.
  Here I have theta.</span> </p><p><span m=''2384000''>This length is A. Well, what
  are the components</span> <span m=''2389000''>of BP? Well, the X component is going</span>
  <span m=''2397000''>to be? Almost.</span> </p><p><span m=''2399000''>I hear people
  saying things about a, but I agree with a.</span> </p><p><span m=''2403000''>I hear
  some cosines. I hear some sines.</span> </p><p><span m=''2404000''>I think it''s
  actually the sine. Yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''2407000''>It''s a(sin(theta)), except
  it''s going to the left.</span> </p><p><span m=''2410000''>So, actually it will
  have a negative a(sin(theta)).</span> </p><p><span m=''2418000''>And, the vertical
  component, well, it will be a(cos(theta)),</span> <span m=''2423000''>but also negative
  because we are going downwards.</span> </p><p><span m=''2427000''>So, it''s negative
  a(cos(theta)). So, now we can answer the</span> <span m=''2446000''>initial question
  because vector OP, well, we just add up OA,</span> <span m=''2452000''>AB, and BP.
  So, the X component will be</span> <span m=''2457000''>a(theta) - a(sin(theta)).
  And, a-a(cos(theta)).</span> </p><p><span m=''2469000''>OK. So, any questions about
  that?</span> </p><p><span m=''2485000''>OK, so, what''s the answer? Because this
  thing here is the</span> <span m=''2489000''>x coordinate as a function of theta,
  and that one is the y</span> <span m=''2495000''>coordinate as a function of theta.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2499000''>So, now, just to show you that we can do a lot of things
  when</span> <span m=''2504000''>we have a parametric equation, here is a small mystery.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2508000''>So, what happens exactly near the bottom point?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2514000''>What does the curve look like? The computer tells us,</span>
  <span m=''2517000''>well, it looks like it has some sort of pointy thing,</span>
  <span m=''2519000''>but isn''t that something of a display?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2522000''>Is it actually what happens? So, what do you think happens</span>
  <span m=''2532000''>near the bottom point? Remember, we had that picture.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2539000''>Let me show you once more, where you have these</span>
  <span m=''2544000''>corner-like things at the bottom.</span> </p><p><span m=''2548000''>Well,
  actually, is it indeed a corner with some</span> <span m=''2551000''>angle between
  the two directions?</span> </p><p><span m=''2554000''>Does it make an angle? Or,
  is it actually a smooth</span> <span m=''2558000''>curve without any corner, but
  we don''t see it because</span> <span m=''2562000''>it''s too small to be visible
  on the computer screen?</span> </p><p><span m=''2566000''>Does it actually make
  a loop? Does it actually come down and</span> <span m=''2570000''>then back up without
  going to the left or to the right and</span> <span m=''2575000''>without making
  an angle? So, yeah, I see the majority</span> <span m=''2581000''>votes for answers
  number two or four.</span> </p><p><span m=''2585000''>And, well, at this point,
  we can''t quite tell.</span> </p><p><span m=''2588000''>So, let''s try to figure
  it out from these formulas.</span> </p><p><span m=''2590000''>The way to answer
  that for sure is to actually look at the</span> <span m=''2597000''>formulas. OK,
  so question that we are</span> <span m=''2603000''>trying to answer now is what
  happens near the bottom point?</span> </p><p><span m=''2632000''>OK, so how do we
  answer that? Well, we should probably try to</span> <span m=''2638000''>find simpler
  formulas for these things.</span> </p><p><span m=''2643000''>Well, to simplify,
  let''s divide everything by a.</span> </p><p><span m=''2646000''>Let''s rescale
  everything by a. If you want,</span> <span m=''2648000''>let''s say that we take
  the unit of length to be the radius of</span> <span m=''2652000''>our wheel. So,
  instead of measuring things</span> <span m=''2655000''>in feet or meters, we''ll
  just measure them in</span> <span m=''2658000''>radius. So, take the length unit
  to be</span> <span m=''2665000''>equal to the radius. So, that means we''ll have
  a=1.</span> </p><p><span m=''2672000''>Then, our formulas are slightly simpler.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2675000''>We get x(theta) is theta - sin(theta), and y equals 1
  - cos</span> <span m=''2685000''>(theta). OK, so, if we want to</span> <span m=''2689000''>understand
  what these things look like, maybe we should try</span> <span m=''2692000''>to take
  some approximation. OK, so what about</span> <span m=''2696000''>approximations?
  Well, probably you know that if</span> <span m=''2700000''>I take the sine of a
  very small angle, it''s close to the actual</span> <span m=''2707000''>angle itself
  if theta is very small.</span> </p><p><span m=''2712000''>And, you know that the
  cosine of an angle that''s very small is</span> <span m=''2718000''>close to one.
  Well, that''s pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m=''2721000''>If we use that, we
  will get theta minus theta,</span> <span m=''2723000''>one minus one, it looks like
  it''s not precise</span> <span m=''2726000''>enough. We just get zero and zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2729000''>That''s not telling us much about what happens.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2731000''>OK, so we need actually better approximations than that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2739000''>So -- So, hopefully you have seen in one variable calculus</span>
  <span m=''2750000''>something called Taylor expansion.</span> </p><p><span m=''2757000''>That''s
  [GROANS]. I see that -- OK,</span> <span m=''2774000''>so if you have not seen Taylor
  expansion,</span> <span m=''2777000''>or somehow it was so traumatic that you''ve
  blocked it out of</span> <span m=''2781000''>your memory, let me just remind you
  that</span> <span m=''2784000''>Taylor expansion is a way to get a better approximation
  than just</span> <span m=''2787000''>looking at the function, its derivative.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2792000''>So -- And, here''s an example of where it actually comes
  in handy</span> <span m=''2802000''>in real life. So, Taylor approximation says</span>
  <span m=''2812000''>that if t is small, then the value of the function,</span> <span
  m=''2821000''>f(t), is approximately equal to,</span> <span m=''2824000''>well,
  our first guess, of course, would be f(0).</span> </p><p><span m=''2827000''>That''s
  our first approximation. If we want to be a bit more</span> <span m=''2832000''>precise,
  we know that when we change by t,</span> <span m=''2835000''>well, t times the derivative
  comes in,</span> <span m=''2837000''>that''s for linear approximation to how the
  function changes.</span> </p><p><span m=''2843000''>Now, if we want to be even more
  precise, there''s another term,</span> <span m=''2848000''>which is t^2 over two
  times the second derivative.</span> </p><p><span m=''2852000''>And, if we want to
  be even more precise, you will have t^3 over</span> <span m=''2857000''>six times
  the third derivative at zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2861000''>OK, and you can
  continue, and so on.</span> </p><p><span m=''2863000''>But, we won''t need more.
  So, if you use this here,</span> <span m=''2869000''>it tells you that the sine
  of a smaller angle,</span> <span m=''2873000''>theta, well, yeah, it looks like
  theta.</span> </p><p><span m=''2877000''>But, if we want to be more precise, then
  we should add</span> <span m=''2881000''>minus theta cubed over six. And, cosine
  of theta,</span> <span m=''2886000''>well, it''s not quite one. It''s close to one
  minus theta</span> <span m=''2892000''>squared over two. OK, so these are slightly</span>
  <span m=''2896000''>better approximations of sine and cosine for small angles.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2901000''>So, now, if we try to figure out, again, what happens
  to our</span> <span m=''2908000''>x of theta, well, it would be,</span> <span m=''2911000''>sorry,
  theta minus theta cubed over six.</span> </p><p><span m=''2916000''>That''s theta
  cubed over six. And y, on the other hand,</span> <span m=''2924000''>is going to
  be one minus that. That''s about theta squared over</span> <span m=''2933000''>two.
  So, now, which one of them is</span> <span m=''2937000''>bigger when theta is small?
  Yeah, y is much larger.</span> </p><p><span m=''2941000''>OK, if you take the cube
  of a very small number,</span> <span m=''2943000''>it becomes very, very, very small.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2946000''>So, in fact, we can look at that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2949000''>So, x, an absolute value, is much smaller than y.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2955000''>And, in fact, what we can do is we can look</span> <span m=''2957000''>at
  the ratio between y and x. That tells us the slope with</span> <span m=''2961000''>which
  we approach the origin. So, y over x is,</span> <span m=''2967000''>well, let''s
  take the ratio of this, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''2975000''>That gives us three
  divided by theta.</span> </p><p><span m=''2978000''>That tends to infinity when
  theta approaches zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2985000''>So, that means that the
  slope of our curve,</span> <span m=''2993000''>the origin is actually infinite.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3000000''>And so, the curve picture is really something like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3005000''>So, the instantaneous motion, if you had to describe
  what</span> <span m=''3007000''>happens very, very close to the origin is</span>
  <span m=''3009000''>that your point is actually not moving to the left or to the</span>
  <span m=''3012000''>right along with the wheel. It''s moving down and up.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3017000''>I mean, at the same time it is actually moving a little
  bit</span> <span m=''3020000''>forward at the same time. But, the dominant motion,</span>
  <span m=''3024000''>near the origin is really where it goes down and back up,</span>
  <span m=''3029000''>so answer number four, you have vertical tangent.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3033000''>OK, I think I''m at the end of time.</span> </p><p><span m=''3037000''>So,
  have a nice weekend. And, I''ll see you on Tuesday.</span> </p><p><span m=''3044000''>So,
  on Tuesday I will have practice exams for next week''s</span> <span m=''3047000''>test.</span>
