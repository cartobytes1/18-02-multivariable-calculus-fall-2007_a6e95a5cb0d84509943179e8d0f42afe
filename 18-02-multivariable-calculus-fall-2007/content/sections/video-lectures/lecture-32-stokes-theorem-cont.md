  <span m=''29000''>which says if I have a closed curve bounding some surface,</span>
  <span m=''37000''>S, and I orient the curve and the</span> <span m=''40000''>surface
  compatible with each other,</span> <span m=''44000''>then I can compute the line
  integral along C along my curve</span> <span m=''53000''>in terms of, instead,</span>
  <span m=''57000''>surface integral for flux of a different vector field,</span>
  <span m=''64000''>namely, curl f dot n dS. OK, so that''s the statement.</span>
  <span m=''72000''>And, just to clarify a little bit, so, again,</span> <span m=''78000''>we''ve
  seen various kinds of integrals.</span> <span m=''84000''>So, line integrals we
  know how to evaluate.</span> <span m=''86000''>They take place in a curve. You express
  everything in terms</span> <span m=''90000''>of one variable, and after substituting,</span>
  <span m=''92000''>you end up with a usual one variable integral that you know</span>
  <span m=''96000''>how to evaluate. And, surface integrals,</span> <span m=''100000''>we
  know also how to evaluate. Namely, we''ve seen various</span> <span m=''104000''>formulas
  for ndS. Once you have such a formula,</span> <span m=''107000''>due to the dot
  product with this vector field,</span> <span m=''110000''>which is not the same
  as that one.</span> <span m=''112000''>But it''s a new vector field that you can
  build out of f.</span> <span m=''116000''>You do the dot product. You express everything
  in terms</span> <span m=''120000''>of your two integration variables, and then you</span>
  <span m=''123000''>evaluate. So, now, what does this have to</span> <span m=''126000''>do
  with various other things? So, one thing I want to say has</span> <span m=''132000''>to
  do with how Stokes helps us understand path independence,</span> <span m=''138000''>so,
  how it actually motivates our criterion for gradient</span> <span m=''144000''>fields,
  independence.</span> <span m=''150000''>OK, so, we''ve seen that if we have a</span>
  <span m=''155000''>vector field defined in a simply connected region,</span> <span
  m=''160000''>and its curl is zero, then it''s a gradient field,</span> <span m=''163000''>and
  the line integral is path independent.</span> <span m=''167000''>So, let me first
  define for you when a simply connected region</span> <span m=''173000''>is. So,
  we say that a region in</span> <span m=''181000''>space is simply connected -- --
  if every closed loop inside this</span> <span m=''197000''>region bounds some surface
  again inside this region.</span> <span m=''211000''>OK, so let me just give you
  some examples just to clarify.</span> <span m=''219000''>So, for example, let''s
  say that I have a region</span> <span m=''226000''>that''s the entire space with
  the origin removed.</span> <span m=''232000''>OK, so space with the origin removed,
  OK, you think it''s</span> <span m=''240000''>simply connected? Who thinks it''s
  simply</span> <span m=''246000''>connected? Who thinks it''s not simply</span> <span
  m=''249000''>connected? Let''s think a little bit harder.</span> <span m=''254000''>Let''s
  say that I take a loop like this one,</span> <span m=''257000''>OK, it doesn''t
  go through the origin.</span> <span m=''260000''>Can I find a surface that''s bounded
  by this loop and that</span> <span m=''264000''>does not pass through the origin?</span>
  <span m=''266000''>Yeah, I can take the sphere, you know, for example,</span> <span
  m=''270000''>or anything that''s just not quite the disk?</span> <span m=''274000''>So,
  and similarly,</span> <span m=''276000''>if I take any other loop that avoids the
  origin,</span> <span m=''279000''>I can find, actually, a surface bounded by it
  that</span> <span m=''282000''>does not pass through the origin.</span> <span m=''284000''>So,
  actually, that''s kind of a not so obvious</span> <span m=''287000''>theorem to
  prove, but maybe intuitively,</span> <span m=''289000''>start by finding any surface.
  Well, if that surface passes</span> <span m=''292000''>through the origin, just
  wiggle it a little bit,</span> <span m=''294000''>you can make sure it doesn''t
  pass through the origin anymore.</span> <span m=''296000''>Just push it a little
  bit. So, in fact,</span> <span m=''300000''>this is simply connected. That was a
  trick question.</span> <span m=''308000''>OK, now on the other hand, a good example
  of something</span> <span m=''313000''>that is not simply connected is if I take
  space,</span> <span m=''316000''>and I remove the z axis -- -- that is not simply
  connected.</span> <span m=''336000''>And, see, the reason is, if I look again, say,</span>
  <span m=''339000''>at the unit circle in the x axis,</span> <span m=''344000''>sorry,
  unit circle in the xy plane,</span> <span m=''347000''>I mean, in the xy plane,
  so, if I try to find a surface</span> <span m=''352000''>whose boundary is this
  disk, well, it has to actually cross</span> <span m=''358000''>the z axis somewhere.
  There''s no way that I can find</span> <span m=''363000''>a surface whose only boundary
  is this curve, which doesn''t hit</span> <span m=''369000''>the z axis anywhere.
  Of course, you could try to use</span> <span m=''373000''>the same trick as there,
  say, maybe we want to go up,</span> <span m=''377000''>up, up. You know, let''s
  start with a</span> <span m=''379000''>cylinder. Well, the problem is you have</span>
  <span m=''381000''>to go infinitely far because the z axis goes infinitely far.</span>
  <span m=''384000''>And, you''ll never be able to actually close your surface.</span>
  <span m=''387000''>So, the matter what kind of trick you might want to use,</span>
  <span m=''390000''>it''s actually a theorem in topology that you cannot find a</span>
  <span m=''394000''>surface bounded by this disk without intersecting the z axis.</span>
  <span m=''399000''>Yes? Well, a doughnut shape</span> <span m=''404000''>certainly
  would stay away from the z axis, but it wouldn''t be a</span> <span m=''407000''>surface
  with boundary just this guy.</span> <span m=''410000''>Right, it would have to have
  either some other boundary.</span> <span m=''413000''>So, maybe what you have in
  mind is some sort of doughnut shape</span> <span m=''417000''>like this that curves
  on itself, and maybe comes back.</span> <span m=''421000''>Well, if you don''t quite
  close it all the way around,</span> <span m=''425000''>so I can try to, indeed,
  draw some sort of</span> <span m=''427000''>doughnut here. Well, if I don''t quite
  close</span> <span m=''430000''>it, that it will have another edge at the other
  end wherever I</span> <span m=''433000''>started. If I close it completely,</span>
  <span m=''435000''>then this curve is no longer its boundary because my surface</span>
  <span m=''438000''>lives on both sides of this curve.</span> <span m=''440000''>See,
  I want a surface that stops on this curve,</span> <span m=''442000''>and doesn''t
  go beyond it. And, nowhere else does it have</span> <span m=''445000''>that kind
  of behavior. Everywhere else,</span> <span m=''448000''>it keeps going on. So,</span>
  <span m=''453000''>actually, I mean, maybe actually another way to</span> <span
  m=''456000''>convince yourself is to find a counter example to the statement</span>
  <span m=''460000''>I''m going to make about vector fields with curl zero and simply</span>
  <span m=''464000''>connected regions always being conservative.</span> <span m=''468000''>So,
  what you can do is you can take the example that we had in</span> <span m=''472000''>one
  of our older problem sets. That was a vector field in the</span> <span m=''475000''>plane.
  But, you can also use it to</span> <span m=''478000''>define a vector field in space
  just with no z component.</span> <span m=''482000''>That vector field is actually
  defined everywhere except on the</span> <span m=''485000''>z axis, and it violates
  the usual theorem that we would</span> <span m=''488000''>expect. So, that''s one
  way to check</span> <span m=''492000''>just for sure that this thing is not simply
  connected.</span> <span m=''500000''>So, what''s the statement I want to make?</span>
  <span m=''506000''>So, recall we''ve seen if F is a gradient field -- -- then its</span>
  <span m=''520000''>curl is zero. That''s just the fact that the</span> <span m=''526000''>mixed
  second partial derivatives are equal.</span> <span m=''529000''>So, now, the converse
  is the following theorem.</span> <span m=''533000''>It says if the curl of F equals
  zero in, sorry,</span> <span m=''541000''>and F is defined -- No, is not the logical
  in which to</span> <span m=''549000''>say it. So, if F is defined in a simply</span>
  <span m=''555000''>connected region, and curl F is zero -- -- then F</span> <span
  m=''570000''>is a gradient field, and the line integral for F is</span> <span m=''585000''>path
  independent -- -- F is conservative,</span> <span m=''593000''>and so on, all the
  usual consequences.</span> <span m=''595000''>Remember, these are all equivalent
  to each other,</span> <span m=''598000''>for example, because you can use path</span>
  <span m=''601000''>independence to define the potential by doing the line</span>
  <span m=''605000''>integral of F. OK, so where do we use the</span> <span m=''608000''>assumption
  of being defined in a simply connected region?</span> <span m=''612000''>Well, the
  way which we will prove this is to use Stokes</span> <span m=''617000''>theorem.
  OK, so the proof,</span> <span m=''620000''>so just going to prove that the line
  integral is path</span> <span m=''625000''>independent; the others work the same
  way.</span> <span m=''629000''>OK, so let''s assume that we have a vector field
  whose curl</span> <span m=''634000''>is zero. And, let''s say that we have two</span>
  <span m=''638000''>curves, C1 and C2, that go from some point P0 to</span> <span
  m=''644000''>some point P1, the same point to the same</span> <span m=''649000''>point.
  Well, we''d like to understand</span> <span m=''654000''>the line integral along
  C1, say, minus the line integral</span> <span m=''660000''>along C2 to show that
  this is zero.</span> <span m=''664000''>That''s what we are trying to prove.</span>
  <span m=''666000''>So, how will we compute that? Well, the line integral along</span>
  <span m=''672000''>C1 minus C2, well, let''s just form a closed curve</span> <span
  m=''677000''>that is C1 minus C2. OK, so let''s call C,</span> <span m=''684000''>woops
  -- So that''s equal to the integral along C of f dot dr</span> <span m=''696000''>where
  C is C1 followed by C2 backwards.</span> <span m=''704000''>Now, C is a closed curve.
  So, I can use Stokes theorem.</span> <span m=''710000''>Well, to be able to use
  Stokes theorem, I need,</span> <span m=''712000''>actually, to find a surface to
  apply it to.</span> <span m=''714000''>And, that''s where the assumption of simply
  connected</span> <span m=''717000''>is useful. I know in advance that any</span>
  <span m=''720000''>closed curve, so, C in particular,</span> <span m=''722000''>has
  to bound some surface. OK, so we can find S,</span> <span m=''730000''>a surface,
  S, that bounds C because the</span> <span m=''741000''>region is simply connected.
  So, now that tells us we can</span> <span m=''752000''>actually apply Stokes theorem,
  except it won''t fit here.</span> <span m=''758000''>So, instead, I will do that
  on the next</span> <span m=''760000''>line. That''s equal by Stokes to the</span>
  <span m=''765000''>double integral over S of curl F dot vector dS,</span> <span
  m=''771000''>or ndS. But now, the curl is zero.</span> <span m=''774000''>So, if
  I integrate zero, I will get zero.</span> <span m=''778000''>OK, so I proved that
  my two line integrals along C1 and C2</span> <span m=''782000''>are equal. But for
  that,</span> <span m=''784000''>I needed to be able to find a surface which to apply
  Stokes</span> <span m=''788000''>theorem. And that required my region to</span>
  <span m=''791000''>be simply connected. If I had a vector field that</span> <span
  m=''794000''>was defined only outside of the z axis and I took two paths that</span>
  <span m=''797000''>went on one side and the other side of the z axis,</span> <span
  m=''800000''>I might have obtained, actually,</span> <span m=''801000''>different
  values of the line integral.</span> <span m=''807000''>OK, so anyway, that''s the
  customary warning</span> <span m=''815000''>about simply connected things. OK, let
  me just mention very</span> <span m=''823000''>quickly that there''s a lot of interesting
  topology you can do,</span> <span m=''826000''>actually in space. So, for example,</span>
  <span m=''828000''>this concept of being simply connected or not,</span> <span m=''830000''>and
  studying which loops bound surfaces or not can be used to</span> <span m=''835000''>classify
  shapes of things inside space.</span> <span m=''838000''>So, for example, one of
  the founding</span> <span m=''847000''>achievements of topology in the 19th century
  was to classify</span> <span m=''855000''>surfaces in space -- -- by trying to look
  at loops on them.</span> <span m=''864000''>So, what I mean by that is that if I
  take the surface of a</span> <span m=''873000''>sphere, well, I claim the surface
  of a sphere</span> <span m=''879000''>-- -- is simply connected. Why is that?</span>
  <span m=''884000''>Well, let''s take my favorite closed curve on the surface of
  a</span> <span m=''889000''>sphere. I can always find a portion of</span> <span
  m=''893000''>the sphere that''s bounded by it. OK, so that''s the definition of</span>
  <span m=''899000''>the surface of a sphere being simply connected.</span> <span
  m=''903000''>On the other hand, if I take what''s called a</span> <span m=''906000''>torus,
  or if you prefer,</span> <span m=''907000''>the surface of a doughnut, that''s more,</span>
  <span m=''910000''>it''s a less technical term, but it''s -- -- well,</span> <span
  m=''921000''>that''s not simply connected. And, in fact,</span> <span m=''924000''>for
  example, if you look at this loop here</span> <span m=''926000''>that goes around
  it, well, of course it bounds a</span> <span m=''929000''>surface in space. But,
  that surface cannot be</span> <span m=''932000''>made to be just a piece of the
  donut.</span> <span m=''935000''>You have to go through the hole. You have to leave
  the surface</span> <span m=''939000''>of a torus. In fact, there''s another one.</span>
  <span m=''941000''>See, this one also does not bound anything that''s completely</span>
  <span m=''947000''>contained in the torus. And, of course,</span> <span m=''950000''>it
  bounds this disc, but inside of a torus.</span> <span m=''953000''>But, that''s
  not a part of the surface itself.</span> <span m=''956000''>So, in fact, there''s,
  and topologists would</span> <span m=''962000''>say, there''s two independent --
  -- loops that don''t bound</span> <span m=''969000''>surfaces, that don''t bound
  anything.</span> <span m=''975000''>And, so this number two is somehow an invariant
  that you</span> <span m=''978000''>can associate to this kind of shape.</span> <span
  m=''980000''>And then, if you consider more complicated surfaces with more</span>
  <span m=''983000''>holes in them, you can try, somehow,</span> <span m=''984000''>to
  count independent loops on them,</span> <span m=''987000''>and that''s the beginning
  of the classification of surfaces.</span> <span m=''993000''>Anyway, that''s not
  really an 18.02 topic, but I thought I</span> <span m=''999000''>would mentioned
  it because it''s kind of a cool idea.</span> <span m=''1005000''>OK, let me say
  a bit more in the way of fun remarks like</span> <span m=''1015000''>that. So, food
  for thought:</span> <span m=''1019000''>let''s say that I want to apply Stokes theorem
  to simplify a</span> <span m=''1025000''>line integral along the curve here.</span>
  <span m=''1028000''>So, this curve is maybe not easy to see in the picture.</span>
  <span m=''1031000''>It kind of goes twice around the z axis, but spirals up and</span>
  <span m=''1037000''>then down. OK, so one way to find a</span> <span m=''1040000''>surface
  that''s bounded by this curve is to take what''s called</span> <span m=''1045000''>the
  Mobius strip. OK, so the Mobius strip,</span> <span m=''1049000''>it''s a one sided
  strip where when you go around,</span> <span m=''1052000''>you flip one side becomes
  the other.</span> <span m=''1055000''>So, you just, if you want to take a band of</span>
  <span m=''1058000''>paper and glue the two sides with a twist,</span> <span m=''1061000''>so,
  it''s a one sided surface. And, that gives us,</span> <span m=''1064000''>actually,
  serious trouble if we try to orient it to apply Stokes</span> <span m=''1069000''>theorem.
  So, see, for example,</span> <span m=''1073000''>if I take this Mobius strip, and
  I try to find an</span> <span m=''1078000''>orientation, so here it looks like that,</span>
  <span m=''1084000''>well, let''s say that I''ve oriented my curve going in this</span>
  <span m=''1088000''>direction. So, I go around,</span> <span m=''1091000''>around,
  around, still going this direction.</span> <span m=''1093000''>Well, the orientation
  I should have for Stokes theorem is that</span> <span m=''1099000''>when I, so,
  curve continues here.</span> <span m=''1102000''>Well, if you look at the convention
  around here,</span> <span m=''1106000''>it tells us that the normal vector should
  be going this way.</span> <span m=''1111000''>OK, if we look at it near here, if
  we walk along this way,</span> <span m=''1115000''>the surface is to our right .
  So, we should actually be</span> <span m=''1117000''>flipping things upside down.
  The normal vector should be</span> <span m=''1120000''>going down. And, in fact,</span>
  <span m=''1121000''>if you try to follow your normal vector that''s pointing</span>
  <span m=''1124000''>up, it''s pointing up, up, up.</span> <span m=''1125000''>It
  will have to go into things, into, into, down.</span> <span m=''1129000''>There''s
  no way to choose consistently a normal vector for</span> <span m=''1133000''>the
  Mobius strip. So, that''s what we call a</span> <span m=''1141000''>non-orientable
  surface. And, that just means it has</span> <span m=''1148000''>only one side. And,
  if it has only one side,</span> <span m=''1150000''>that we cannot speak of flux
  for it because we have no way of</span> <span m=''1154000''>saying that we''ll be
  counting things positively one way,</span> <span m=''1157000''>negatively the other
  way, because there''s only one,</span> <span m=''1159000''>you know, there''s no
  notion of sides.</span> <span m=''1162000''>So, you can''t define a side towards
  which things will be</span> <span m=''1166000''>going positively. So, that''s actually
  a situation</span> <span m=''1174000''>where flux cannot be defined. OK, so as much
  as Mobius strips</span> <span m=''1184000''>and climb-bottles are exciting and really
  cool,</span> <span m=''1188000''>well, we can''t use them in this class because
  we can''t define</span> <span m=''1191000''>flux through them. So, if we really
  wanted to</span> <span m=''1194000''>apply Stokes theorem, because I''ve been telling
  you</span> <span m=''1197000''>that space is simply connected, and I will always
  be able to</span> <span m=''1199000''>apply Stokes theorem to any curve,</span>
  <span m=''1201000''>what would I do? Well, I claim this curve</span> <span m=''1205000''>actually
  bounds another surface that is orientable.</span> <span m=''1210000''>Yeah, that
  looks counterintuitive.</span> <span m=''1211000''>Well, let''s see it. I claim
  you can take a</span> <span m=''1216000''>hemisphere, and you can take a small thing
  and twist it around.</span> <span m=''1222000''>So, in case you don''t believe me,
  let me do it again with the</span> <span m=''1226000''>transparency. Here''s my
  loop,</span> <span m=''1228000''>and see, well, the scale is not exactly the</span>
  <span m=''1231000''>same. So, it doesn''t quite match.</span> <span m=''1233000''>But,
  and it''s getting a bit dark.</span> <span m=''1235000''>But, that spherical thing
  with a little slit going twisting</span> <span m=''1241000''>into it will actually
  have boundary my loop.</span> <span m=''1246000''>And, that one is orientable. I
  mean, I leave it up to you to</span> <span m=''1250000''>stare at the picture long
  enough to convince yourselves that</span> <span m=''1256000''>there''s a well-defined
  up and down.</span> <span m=''1260000''>OK. So now, I mean,</span> <span m=''1271000''>in
  case you are getting really, really worried,</span> <span m=''1274000''>I mean,
  there won''t be any Mobius strips on the exam on</span> <span m=''1278000''>Tuesday,
  OK? It''s just to show you some cool</span> <span m=''1284000''>stuff. OK, questions?</span>
  <span m=''1289000''>No? OK, one last thing I want to</span> <span m=''1294000''>show
  you before we start reviewing,</span> <span m=''1298000''>so one question you might
  have about Stokes theorem is,</span> <span m=''1301000''>how come we can choose
  whatever surface we want?</span> <span m=''1304000''>I mean, sure, it seems to work,</span>
  <span m=''1307000''>but why? So, I''m going to say a couple</span> <span m=''1312000''>of
  words about surface independence in Stokes theorem.</span> <span m=''1322000''>So,
  let''s say that I have a curve, C, in space.</span> <span m=''1328000''>And, let''s
  say that I want to apply Stokes theorem.</span> <span m=''1331000''>So, then I can
  choose my favorite surface bounded by C.</span> <span m=''1336000''>So, in a situation
  like this, for example,</span> <span m=''1338000''>I might want to make my first
  choice be this guy,</span> <span m=''1341000''>S1, like maybe some sort of upper
  half sphere.</span> <span m=''1345000''>And, if you pay attention to the orientation
  conventions,</span> <span m=''1348000''>you''ll see that you need to take it with
  normal vector</span> <span m=''1351000''>pointing up. Maybe actually I would rather</span>
  <span m=''1354000''>make a different choice. And actually,</span> <span m=''1356000''>I
  will choose another surface, S2, that maybe looks like that.</span> <span m=''1361000''>And,
  if I look carefully at the orientation convention,</span> <span m=''1364000''>Stokes
  theorem tells me that I have to take the normal vector</span> <span m=''1367000''>pointing
  up again. So, that''s actually into things.</span> <span m=''1372000''>So, Stokes
  says that the line</span> <span m=''1377000''>integral along C of my favorite vector
  field can be computed</span> <span m=''1384000''>either as a flux integral for the
  curl through S1,</span> <span m=''1389000''>or as the same integral, but through
  S2 instead of S1.</span> <span m=''1396000''>So, that seems to suggest that curl
  F has some sort of surface</span> <span m=''1401000''>independence property. It
  doesn''t really matter which</span> <span m=''1404000''>surface I take, as long
  as the boundary is this</span> <span m=''1407000''>given curve, C. Why is that?</span>
  <span m=''1409000''>That''s a strange property to have.</span> <span m=''1411000''>Where
  does it come from? Well, let''s think about it for</span> <span m=''1416000''>a
  second. So, why are these the same?</span> <span m=''1420000''>I mean, of course,
  they have to be the same</span> <span m=''1422000''>because that''s what Stokes
  tell us.</span> <span m=''1424000''>But, why is that OK? Well, let''s think about</span>
  <span m=''1428000''>comparing the flux integral for S1 and the flux integral for
  S2.</span> <span m=''1433000''>So, if we want to compare them, we should probably
  subtract</span> <span m=''1437000''>them from each other. OK, so let''s do the flux</span>
  <span m=''1442000''>integral for S1 minus the flux integral for S2 of the same</span>
  <span m=''1449000''>thing. Well, let''s give a name.</span> <span m=''1452000''>Let''s
  call S the surface S1 minus S2.</span> <span m=''1458000''>So, what is S? S is S1
  with its given</span> <span m=''1461000''>orientation together with S2 with the
  reversed orientation.</span> <span m=''1466000''>So, S is actually this whole closed
  surface here.</span> <span m=''1472000''>And, the normal vector to S seems to be
  pointing outwards</span> <span m=''1477000''>everywhere. OK, so now, if we have
  a closed</span> <span m=''1479000''>surface with a normal vector pointing outwards,</span>
  <span m=''1481000''>and we want to find a flux integral for it,</span> <span m=''1484000''>well,
  we can replace that with a</span> <span m=''1487000''>triple integral. So, that''s
  the divergence</span> <span m=''1497000''>theorem. So, that''s by the divergence</span>
  <span m=''1503000''>theorem using the fact that S is a closed surface.</span> <span
  m=''1509000''>That''s equal to the triple integral over the region inside.</span>
  <span m=''1513000''>Let me call that region D of divergence, of curl F dV.</span>
  <span m=''1526000''>OK, and what I''m going to claim now is that we can actually</span>
  <span m=''1534000''>check that if you take the divergence of the curl of a</span>
  <span m=''1541000''>vector field, you always get zero.</span> <span m=''1547000''>OK,
  and so that will tell you that this integral will always</span> <span m=''1550000''>be
  zero. And that''s why the flux for S1,</span> <span m=''1553000''>and the flux for
  S2 were the same a priori and we didn''t have</span> <span m=''1558000''>to worry
  about which one we chose when we did Stokes</span> <span m=''1561000''>theorem.
  OK, so let''s just check quickly</span> <span m=''1566000''>that divergence of a
  curve is zero.</span> <span m=''1570000''>OK, in case you''re wondering why I''m
  doing all this,</span> <span m=''1572000''>well, first I think it''s kind of interesting,</span>
  <span m=''1573000''>and second, it reminds you of a statement of all these theorems,</span>
  <span m=''1577000''>and all these definitions. So, in a way,</span> <span m=''1579000''>we
  are already reviewing. OK, so let''s see.</span> <span m=''1585000''>If my vector
  field has components P,</span> <span m=''1590000''>Q, and R, remember that the curl
  was defined by this cross</span> <span m=''1599000''>product between del and our
  given vector field.</span> <span m=''1607000''>So, that''s Ry - Qz followed by Pz
  - Rx, and Qx - Py.</span> <span m=''1624000''>So, now, we want to take the divergence
  of this.</span> <span m=''1634000''>Well, so we have to take the first component,</span>
  <span m=''1639000''>Ry minus Qz, and take its partial with</span> <span m=''1643000''>respect
  to x. Then, take the y component,</span> <span m=''1648000''>Pz minus Rx partial
  with respect to y plus Qx minus Py</span> <span m=''1655000''>partial with respect
  to z. And, well, now we should expand</span> <span m=''1661000''>this. But I claim
  it will always</span> <span m=''1663000''>simplify to zero.</span> <span m=''1691000''>OK,
  so I think we have over there, becomes R sub yx minus Q</span> <span m=''1704000''>sub
  zx plus P sub zy minus R sub xy plus Q sub xz minus P sub yz.</span> <span m=''1719000''>Well,
  let''s see. We have P sub zy minus P sub yz.</span> <span m=''1727000''>These two
  cancel out. We have R sub yx minus R sub xy.</span> <span m=''1734000''>These cancel
  out. Q sub zx and Q sub xz,</span> <span m=''1738000''>these two also cancel out.
  So, indeed, the divergence of a</span> <span m=''1744000''>curl is always zero.
  OK, so the claim is divergence</span> <span m=''1750000''>of curl is always zero.
  Del cross F is always zero,</span> <span m=''1757000''>and just a small remark,
  if we had actually real vectors</span> <span m=''1766000''>rather than this strange
  del guy,</span> <span m=''1770000''>indeed we know that if we have two vectors,</span>
  <span m=''1773000''>U and V, and we do u dot u cross v,</span> <span m=''1777000''>what
  is that? Well, one way to say it is it''s</span> <span m=''1780000''>the determinant
  of u, u, and v, which is the volume</span> <span m=''1783000''>of the box. But,
  it''s completely flat</span> <span m=''1785000''>because u, u, and v are all in
  the plane</span> <span m=''1787000''>defined by u and v. The other way to say it
  is that</span> <span m=''1790000''>u cross v is perpendicular to u and v.</span>
  <span m=''1793000''>Well, if it''s perpendicular u, then its dot product with u</span>
  <span m=''1796000''>will be zero. So, no matter how you say it,</span> <span m=''1799000''>this
  is always zero. So, in a way,</span> <span m=''1802000''>this reinforces our intuition
  that del, even though it''s not</span> <span m=''1809000''>at all an actual vector
  sometimes can be manipulated in</span> <span m=''1815000''>the same way. OK, I think
  that''s it for new</span> <span m=''1820000''>topics for today. And,</span> <span
  m=''1826000''>so, now I should maybe try to recap quickly what we''ve learned</span>
  <span m=''1830000''>in these past three weeks so that you know,</span> <span m=''1834000''>so,
  the exam is probably going to be similar in difficulty to</span> <span m=''1839000''>the
  practice exams. That''s my goal.</span> <span m=''1842000''>I don''t know if I will
  have reached that goal or not.</span> <span m=''1845000''>We''ll only know that
  after you''ve taken the test.</span> <span m=''1848000''>But, the idea is it''s
  meant to be more or less the same level</span> <span m=''1853000''>of difficulty.
  So, at this point,</span> <span m=''1858000''>we''ve learned about three kinds of
  beasts in space.</span> <span m=''1866000''>OK, so I''m going to divide my blackboard
  into three pieces,</span> <span m=''1872000''>and here I will write triple integrals.</span>
  <span m=''1876000''>We''ve learned about double integrals, and we''ve learned</span>
  <span m=''1880000''>about line integrals. OK, so triple integrals over a</span>
  <span m=''1886000''>region in space, we integrate a scalar quantity,</span> <span
  m=''1893000''>dV. How do we do that?</span> <span m=''1895000''>Well, we can do
  that in rectangular coordinates where dV</span> <span m=''1901000''>becomes something
  like, maybe, dz dx dy,</span> <span m=''1906000''>or any permutation of these. We''ve
  seen how to do it also in</span> <span m=''1912000''>cylindrical coordinates where
  dV is maybe dz times r dr d theta</span> <span m=''1919000''>or more commonly r
  dr d theta dz.</span> <span m=''1922000''>But, what I want to emphasize in this
  way is that both of</span> <span m=''1926000''>these you set up pretty much in the
  same way.</span> <span m=''1929000''>So, remember, the main trick here is to find</span>
  <span m=''1932000''>the bounds of integration. So, when you do it,</span> <span
  m=''1935000''>say, with dz first, that means for fixed xy,</span> <span m=''1938000''>so,
  for a fixed point in the xy plane, you have to look at the</span> <span m=''1943000''>bounds
  for z. So, that means you have to</span> <span m=''1945000''>figure out what''s
  the bottom surface of your solid,</span> <span m=''1948000''>and what''s the top
  surface of your solid?</span> <span m=''1951000''>And, you have to find the value
  of z at the bottom,</span> <span m=''1954000''>the value of z at the top as functions
  of x and y.</span> <span m=''1957000''>And then, you will put that as bounds for
  z.</span> <span m=''1960000''>Once you''ve done that, you are left with the question</span>
  <span m=''1963000''>of finding bounds for x and y. Well, for that,</span> <span
  m=''1965000''>you just rotate the picture, look at your solid from above,</span>
  <span m=''1969000''>so, look at its projection to the xy plane,</span> <span m=''1972000''>and
  you set up a double integral either in rectangular</span> <span m=''1976000''>xy
  coordinates, or in polar coordinates for x</span> <span m=''1982000''>and y. Of
  course, you can always do it</span> <span m=''1984000''>a different orders. And,
  I''ll let you figure out</span> <span m=''1988000''>again how that goes. But, if
  you do dz first,</span> <span m=''1991000''>then the inner bounds are given by bottom
  and top,</span> <span m=''1995000''>and the outer ones are given by looking at the
  shadow of the</span> <span m=''2000000''>region. Now, there''s also spherical</span>
  <span m=''2003000''>coordinates. And there, we''ve seen that dV</span> <span m=''2008000''>is
  rho squared sine phi d rho d phi d theta.</span> <span m=''2012000''>So now, of
  course, if this orgy of Greek letters</span> <span m=''2015000''>is confusing you
  at this point, then you probably need to first</span> <span m=''2019000''>review
  spherical coordinates for themselves.</span> <span m=''2021000''>Remember that rho
  is the distance from the origin.</span> <span m=''2024000''>Phi is the angle down
  from the z axis.</span> <span m=''2027000''>So, it''s zero, and the positive z axis,</span>
  <span m=''2029000''>pi over two in the xy plane, and increases all the way to pi</span>
  <span m=''2033000''>on the negative z axis. And, theta is the angle around</span>
  <span m=''2039000''>the z axis. So, now, when we set up bounds</span> <span m=''2042000''>here,
  it will look a lot like what</span> <span m=''2044000''>you''ve done in polar coordinates
  in the plane because when you</span> <span m=''2047000''>look at the inner bound
  down on rho,</span> <span m=''2049000''>for a fixed phi and theta, that means you''re
  shooting a</span> <span m=''2052000''>straight ray from the origin in some direction
  in space.</span> <span m=''2055000''>So, you know, you''re sending a laser beam,</span>
  <span m=''2057000''>and you want to know what part of your beam is going to be in</span>
  <span m=''2060000''>your given solid. You want to solve for the value</span> <span
  m=''2063000''>of rho when you enter the solid and when you leave it.</span> <span
  m=''2066000''>I mean, very often, if the origin is in your solid,</span> <span m=''2069000''>then
  rho will start at zero. Then you want to know when you</span> <span m=''2073000''>exit.
  And, I mean,</span> <span m=''2074000''>there''s a fairly small list of kinds of
  surfaces that we''ve</span> <span m=''2078000''>seen how to set up in spherical
  coordinates.</span> <span m=''2081000''>So, if you''re really upset by this, go
  over the problems in</span> <span m=''2084000''>the notes. That will give you a
  good idea</span> <span m=''2087000''>of what kinds of things we''ve seen in spherical
  coordinates.</span> <span m=''2093000''>OK, and then evaluation is the usual way.</span>
  <span m=''2096000''>Questions about this? No?</span> <span m=''2101000''>OK, so,
  I should say we can do something bad,</span> <span m=''2108000''>but so we''ve seen,
  of course, applications of</span> <span m=''2115000''>this. So, we should know how
  to use a</span> <span m=''2119000''>triple integral to evaluate things like a mass
  of a solid,</span> <span m=''2124000''>the average value of a function,</span> <span
  m=''2129000''>the moment of inertia about one of the coordinate axes,</span> <span
  m=''2137000''>or the gravitational attraction on a mass at the origin.</span> <span
  m=''2154000''>OK, so these are just formulas to remember for examples of</span>
  <span m=''2158000''>triple integrals. It doesn''t change conceptually.</span> <span
  m=''2161000''>You always set them up and evaluate them the same way.</span> <span
  m=''2164000''>It just tells you what to put there for the integrand.</span> <span
  m=''2171000''>Now, double integrals: so,</span> <span m=''2175000''>when we have
  a surface in space,</span> <span m=''2178000''>well, what we will integrate on it,</span>
  <span m=''2181000''>at least what we''ve seen how to integrate is a vector field</span>
  <span m=''2186000''>dotted with the unit normal vector times the area element.</span>
  <span m=''2191000''>OK, and this is sometimes called vector dS.</span> <span m=''2198000''>Now,
  how do we evaluate that? Well, we''ve seen formulas for</span> <span m=''2208000''>ndS
  in various settings. And, once you have a formula</span> <span m=''2215000''>for
  ndS, that will relate ndS to maybe dx dy, or something else.</span> <span m=''2221000''>And
  then, you will express, so, for example,</span> <span m=''2227000''>ndS equals something
  dx dy. And then, it becomes a double</span> <span m=''2235000''>integral of something
  dx dy. Now, in the integrand,</span> <span m=''2241000''>you want to express everything
  in terms of x and y.</span> <span m=''2243000''>So, if you had a z, maybe you have
  a formula for z</span> <span m=''2246000''>in terms of x and y. And, when you set
  up the</span> <span m=''2248000''>bounds, well, you try to figure out what are</span>
  <span m=''2250000''>the bounds for x and y? That would be just looking at</span>
  <span m=''2253000''>it from above. Of course, if you are using</span> <span m=''2255000''>other
  variables, figure out the bounds for those</span> <span m=''2257000''>variables.
  And, when you''ve done that,</span> <span m=''2260000''>it becomes just a double
  integral in the usual sense.</span> <span m=''2264000''>OK, so maybe I should be
  a bit more explicit about formulas</span> <span m=''2266000''>because there have
  been a lot. So, let me tell you about a few</span> <span m=''2272000''>of them.
  Let me actually do that over</span> <span m=''2276000''>here because I don''t want
  to make this too crowded.</span> <span m=''2304000''>OK, so what kinds of formulas
  for ndS have we seen?</span> <span m=''2308000''>Well, we''ve seen a formula, for
  example,</span> <span m=''2312000''>for a horizontal plane, or for something that''s</span>
  <span m=''2317000''>parallel to the yz plane or the xz plane.</span> <span m=''2322000''>Well,
  let''s do just the yz plane for a quick reminder.</span> <span m=''2327000''>So,
  if I have a surface that''s contained inside the yz plane,</span> <span m=''2332000''>then
  obviously I will express ds in terms of,</span> <span m=''2336000''>well, I will
  use y and z as my variables.</span> <span m=''2341000''>So, I will say that ds is
  dy dz, or dz dy,</span> <span m=''2345000''>whatever''s most convenient. Maybe we
  will even switch to</span> <span m=''2351000''>polar coordinates after that if a
  problem wants us to.</span> <span m=''2355000''>And, what about the normal vector?</span>
  <span m=''2356000''>Well, the normal vector is either coming straight at us,</span>
  <span m=''2361000''>or it''s maybe going back away from us depending on which</span>
  <span m=''2366000''>orientation we''ve chosen. So, this gives us ndS.</span> <span
  m=''2370000''>We dot our favorite vector field with it.</span> <span m=''2372000''>We
  integrate, and we get the answer.</span> <span m=''2378000''>OK, we''ve seen about
  spheres and cylinders centered at the</span> <span m=''2388000''>origin or centered
  on the z axis.</span> <span m=''2394000''>So, the normal vector sticks straight
  out or straight in,</span> <span m=''2400000''>depending on which direction you
  do it in.</span> <span m=''2405000''>So, for a sphere, the normal vector is <x,</span>
  <span m=''2409000''>y, z> divided by the radius of the sphere.</span> <span m=''2414000''>For
  a cylinder, it''s <x, y,</span> <span m=''2417000''>0>, divided by the radius of
  a cylinder.</span> <span m=''2421000''>And, the surface element on a sphere,</span>
  <span m=''2425000''>so, see, it''s very closely related to the volume element of</span>
  <span m=''2428000''>spherical coordinates except you don''t have a rho anymore.</span>
  <span m=''2431000''>You just plug in a rho equals a. So, you get a squared sine
  phi</span> <span m=''2437000''>d phi d theta. And, for a cylinder,</span> <span
  m=''2441000''>it would be a dz d theta. So,</span> <span m=''2447000''>by the way,
  just a quick check, when you''re doing an integral,</span> <span m=''2451000''>if
  it''s the surface integral, there should be two integral</span> <span m=''2455000''>signs,
  and there should be two</span> <span m=''2456000''>integration variables. And, there
  should be two d</span> <span m=''2459000''>somethings. If you end up with a dx,</span>
  <span m=''2463000''>dy, dz in the surface integral, something is seriously wrong.</span>
  <span m=''2470000''>OK, now, besides these specific formulas, we''ve seen two general</span>
  <span m=''2478000''>formulas that are also useful. So, one is,</span> <span m=''2484000''>if
  we know how to express z in terms of x and y,</span> <span m=''2489000''>and just
  to change notation to show you that it''s not set in</span> <span m=''2493000''>stone,
  let''s say that z is known as a</span> <span m=''2496000''>function z of x and y.
  So, how do I get ndS in that</span> <span m=''2502000''>case? Well, we''ve seen
  a formula that</span> <span m=''2505000''>says negative partial z partial x, negative
  partial z partial y,</span> <span m=''2511000''>one dx dy. So, this formula relates
  the</span> <span m=''2514000''>volume, sorry, the surface element on our</span>
  <span m=''2517000''>surface to the area element in the xy plane.</span> <span m=''2521000''>It
  lets us convert between dS and dx dy.</span> <span m=''2528000''>OK, so we just
  plug in this, and we dot with F,</span> <span m=''2531000''>and then we substitute
  everything in terms of x and y,</span> <span m=''2534000''>and we evaluate the integral
  over x and y.</span> <span m=''2537000''>If we don''t really want to find a way
  to find z as a function of</span> <span m=''2542000''>x and y, but we have a normal
  vector</span> <span m=''2549000''>given to us, then we have another formula</span>
  <span m=''2555000''>which says that ndS is, sorry, I should have said it''s</span>
  <span m=''2559000''>always up to sign because we have a two orientation</span> <span
  m=''2562000''>convention. We have to decide based on what</span> <span m=''2565000''>we
  are trying to do, whether we are doing the</span> <span m=''2568000''>correct convention
  or the wrong one.</span> <span m=''2571000''>So, the other formula is n over n dot
  k dx dy.</span> <span m=''2582000''>Sorry, are they all the same? Well, if you want,</span>
  <span m=''2589000''>you can put an absolute value here.</span> <span m=''2592000''>But,
  it doesn''t matter because it''s up to sign anyway.</span> <span m=''2596000''>So,
  I mean, this formula is valid as it is.</span> <span m=''2602000''>OK, and, I mean,
  if you''re in a situation where</span> <span m=''2604000''>you can apply more than
  one formula,</span> <span m=''2606000''>they will all give you the same answer in
  the end because it''s</span> <span m=''2612000''>the same flux integral. OK, so
  anyway,</span> <span m=''2617000''>so we have various ways of computing surface
  integrals,</span> <span m=''2620000''>and probably one of the best possible things
  you can do to</span> <span m=''2624000''>prepare for the test is actually to look
  again at some practice</span> <span m=''2628000''>problems from the notes that do
  flux integrals over various</span> <span m=''2631000''>kinds of surfaces because
  that''s probably one of the hardest</span> <span m=''2635000''>topics in this unit
  of the class.</span> <span m=''2638000''>OK, anyway, let''s move on to line integrals.</span>
  <span m=''2645000''>So, those are actually a piece of cake in comparison,</span>
  <span m=''2651000''>OK, because all that this is, is just integral of P dx Q dy
  R</span> <span m=''2657000''>dz. And, then all you have to do is</span> <span m=''2664000''>parameterize
  the curve, C, to express everything in</span> <span m=''2675000''>terms of a single
  variable. And then, you end up with a</span> <span m=''2682000''>usual single integral,
  and you can just compute it.</span> <span m=''2686000''>So, that one works pretty
  much as it did in the plane.</span> <span m=''2688000''>So, if you forgotten what
  we did in the plane,</span> <span m=''2692000''>it''s really the same thing. OK,
  so now we have three</span> <span m=''2696000''>different kinds of integrals, and
  really, well,</span> <span m=''2698000''>they certainly have in common that they
  integrate things</span> <span m=''2701000''>somehow. But, apart from that,</span>
  <span m=''2703000''>they are extremely different in what they do.</span> <span m=''2705000''>I
  mean, this one involves a function, a scalar quantity.</span> <span m=''2708000''>These
  involve vector quantities. They don''t involve the same</span> <span m=''2711000''>kinds
  of shapes over which to integrate.</span> <span m=''2713000''>Here, you integrate
  over a three-dimensional region.</span> <span m=''2716000''>Here, you integrate
  only over a two-dimensional surface,</span> <span m=''2719000''>and here, only a
  one-dimensional curve.</span> <span m=''2721000''>So, try not to confuse them. That''s
  basically the most</span> <span m=''2724000''>important advice. Don''t get mistaken.</span>
  <span m=''2727000''>Each of them has a different way of getting evaluated.</span>
  <span m=''2730000''>Eventually, they will all give you numbers, but through</span>
  <span m=''2734000''>different processes. So now, well,</span> <span m=''2736000''>I
  said these guys are completely different.</span> <span m=''2738000''>Well, they
  are, but we still have some bridges</span> <span m=''2740000''>between them. OK,
  so we have two,</span> <span m=''2742000''>maybe I should say three, well, two bridges
  between these</span> <span m=''2746000''>guys. OK, so we have somehow a</span> <span
  m=''2749000''>connection between these which is the divergence theorem.</span> <span
  m=''2754000''>We have a connection between that, which is Stokes theorem.</span>
  <span m=''2762000''>So -- Just to write them again, so the divergence theorem says</span>
  <span m=''2780000''>if I have a region in space, and I call its boundary S,</span>
  <span m=''2785000''>so, it''s going to be a closed surface,</span> <span m=''2787000''>and
  I orient S with a normal vector pointing outwards,</span> <span m=''2791000''>then
  whenever I have a surface integral over S,</span> <span m=''2795000''>sorry, I can
  replace it by a triple</span> <span m=''2800000''>integral over the region inside.
  OK, so this guy is a vector</span> <span m=''2807000''>field. And, this guy is a
  function</span> <span m=''2809000''>that somehow relates to the vector field.</span>
  <span m=''2812000''>I mean, you should know how. You should know the definition</span>
  <span m=''2814000''>of divergence, of course.</span> <span m=''2815000''>But, what
  I want to point out is if you have to compute the</span> <span m=''2819000''>two
  sides separately, well, this is just,</span> <span m=''2821000''>you know, your
  standard flux integral.</span> <span m=''2824000''>This is just your standard triple
  integral over a region in</span> <span m=''2827000''>space. Once you have computed
  what</span> <span m=''2829000''>this guy is, it''s really just a triple integral
  of the function.</span> <span m=''2833000''>So, the way in which you compute it
  doesn''t see that it</span> <span m=''2836000''>came from a divergence. It''s just
  the same way that you</span> <span m=''2839000''>would compute any other triple
  integral.</span> <span m=''2843000''>The way we compute it doesn''t depend on what
  actually we are</span> <span m=''2848000''>integrating. Stokes theorem says if I
  have a</span> <span m=''2852000''>curve that''s the boundary of a surface, S,</span>
  <span m=''2855000''>and I orient the two in compatible manners,</span> <span m=''2860000''>then
  I can replace a line integral on C by a surface</span> <span m=''2872000''>integral
  on S. OK, and that surface integral,</span> <span m=''2877000''>well, it''s not
  for the same vector field.</span> <span m=''2880000''>This relates a line integral
  for one field to a surface</span> <span m=''2883000''>integral from another field.
  That other field is given from</span> <span m=''2886000''>the first one just by
  taking its curl So, after you take the</span> <span m=''2890000''>curl, you obtain
  a different vector field.</span> <span m=''2893000''>And, the way in which you would
  compute the surface integral is</span> <span m=''2897000''>just as with any surface
  integral.</span> <span m=''2899000''>You just find a formula for ndS dot product,
  substitute,</span> <span m=''2903000''>evaluate. The calculation of this thing,</span>
  <span m=''2906000''>once you''ve computed curl does not remember that it was a curl.</span>
  <span m=''2910000''>It''s the same as with any other flux integral.</span> <span
  m=''2913000''>OK, and finally, the last bridge,</span> <span m=''2915000''>so this
  was between two and three.</span> <span m=''2918000''>This was between one and two.
  Let me just say,</span> <span m=''2921000''>there''s a bridge between zero and one,</span>
  <span m=''2925000''>which is that if you have a function in its gradient,</span>
  <span m=''2933000''>well, the fundamental theorem of calculus says that the line</span>
  <span m=''2937000''>integral for the vector field given by the gradient of a</span>
  <span m=''2941000''>function is actually equal to the change in value of a</span>
  <span m=''2944000''>function. That''s if you have a curve</span> <span m=''2948000''>bounded
  by P0 and P1. So in a way, actually,</span> <span m=''2951000''>each of these three
  theorems relates a quantity with a</span> <span m=''2955000''>certain number of
  integral signs to a quantity with one more</span> <span m=''2959000''>integral sign.
  And, that''s actually somehow a</span> <span m=''2962000''>fundamental similarity
  between them.</span> <span m=''2964000''>But maybe it''s easier to think of them
  as completely different</span> <span m=''2967000''>stories. So now, with this one,</span>
  <span m=''2970000''>we additionally have to remember another topic is given</span>
  <span m=''2976000''>a vector field, F, with curl equal to zero,</span> <span m=''2981000''>find
  the potential. And, we''ve seen two methods for</span> <span m=''2985000''>that,
  and I''m sure you remember them.</span> <span m=''2987000''>So, if not, then try
  to remember them for Tuesday.</span> <span m=''2993000''>OK, so anyway, again, conceptually,</span>
  <span m=''2994000''>we have, really, three different kinds of</span> <span m=''2996000''>integrals.
  We evaluated them in completely</span> <span m=''2999000''>different ways, and we
  have a handful of</span> <span m=''3001000''>theorems, connecting them to each other.</span>
  <span m=''3003000''>But, that doesn''t have any impact on how we actually</span>
  <span m=''3006000''>compute things.</span> </p>'
