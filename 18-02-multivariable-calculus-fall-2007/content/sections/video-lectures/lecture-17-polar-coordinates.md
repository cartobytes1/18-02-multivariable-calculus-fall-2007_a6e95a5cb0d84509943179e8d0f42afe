  <span m='23000'>Yesterday we saw how to define double integrals and how to</span>
  <span m='28000'>start computing them in terms of x and y coordinates.</span> <span
  m='33000'>We have defined the double integral over a region R and</span> <span m='41000'>plane
  of a function f of x, y dA.</span> <span m='45000'>You cannot hear me? Is the sound
  working?</span> <span m='51000'>Can you hear me in the back now? Can we make the
  sound louder?</span> <span m='57000'>Does this work? People are not hearing me in</span>
  <span m='61000'>the back. Is it better?</span> <span m='65000'>People are still
  saying make it louder.</span> <span m='69000'>Is it better? OK.</span> <span m='71000'>Great.
  Thanks.</span> <span m='78000'>That's not a reason to start chatting with your friends.</span>
  <span m='82000'>Thanks. When we have a region in the x,</span> <span m='87000'>y
  plane and we have a function of x and y,</span> <span m='91000'>we are defining
  the double integral of f over this region</span> <span m='96000'>by taking basically
  the sum of the values of a function</span> <span m='100000'>everywhere in here times
  the area element.</span> <span m='104000'>And the definition, actually, is we split
  the region into</span> <span m='108000'>lots of tiny little pieces, we multiply
  the value of a</span> <span m='112000'>function at the point times the area of a
  little piece and we</span> <span m='115000'>sum that everywhere. And we have seen,</span>
  <span m='119000'>actually, how to compute these things as iterated integrals.</span>
  <span m='127000'>First, integrating over dy and then over dx,</span> <span m='134000'>or
  the other way around. One example that we did,</span> <span m='141000'>in particular,
  was to compute the double</span> <span m='145000'>integral of a quarter of a unit
  disk.</span> <span m='149000'>That was the region where x squared plus y squared
  is less</span> <span m='155000'>than one and x and y are positive, of one minus
  x squared</span> <span m='160000'>minus y squared dA. Well, hopefully,</span> <span
  m='163000'>I kind of convinced you that we can do it using enough trig and</span>
  <span m='168000'>substitutions and so on, but it is not very pleasant.</span> <span
  m='172000'>And the reason for that is that using x and y coordinates here</span>
  <span m='176000'>does not seem very appropriate. In fact, we can use polar</span>
  <span m='184000'>coordinates instead to compute this double integral.</span> <span
  m='196000'>Remember that polar coordinates are about replacing x and y as</span>
  <span m='202000'>coordinates for a point on a plane by instead r,</span> <span m='208000'>which
  is the distance from the origin to a point,</span> <span m='211000'>and theta, which
  is the angle measured</span> <span m='215000'>counterclockwise from the positive
  x-axis.</span> <span m='220000'>In terms of r and theta, you have x equals r cosine</span>
  <span m='228000'>theta, y equals r sine theta. The claim is we are able,</span>
  <span m='234000'>actually, to do double integrals in polar coordinates.</span> <span
  m='239000'>We just have to learn how to. Just to draw a quick picture --</span>
  <span m='246000'>When we were integrating in x, y coordinates,</span> <span m='252000'>in
  rectangular coordinates, we were slicing our region by</span> <span m='256000'>gridlines
  that were either horizontal or vertical.</span> <span m='260000'>And we used that
  to set up the iterated integral.</span> <span m='263000'>And we said dA became dx
  dy or dy dx.</span> <span m='268000'>Now we are going to actually integrate, in
  terms of the polar</span> <span m='275000'>coordinates, r and theta. Let's say we
  will integrate in</span> <span m='281000'>the order with r first and then theta.</span>
  <span m='285000'>That is the order that makes the most sense usually when you</span>
  <span m='290000'>do polar coordinates. What does that mean?</span> <span m='293000'>It
  means that we will first focus on a slice where we fix</span> <span m='298000'>the
  value of theta and we will let r vary.</span> <span m='302000'>That means we fix
  a direction, we fix a ray out from the</span> <span m='306000'>origin in a certain
  direction. And we will travel along this</span> <span m='311000'>ray and see which
  part of it, which values of r are in our</span> <span m='315000'>region. Here it
  will be actually pretty</span> <span m='318000'>easy because r will just start at
  zero, and you will have to</span> <span m='324000'>stop when you exit this quarter
  disk.</span> <span m='328000'>Well, what is the equation of this circle in polar</span>
  <span m='331000'>coordinates? It is just r equals one.</span> <span m='334000'>So,
  we will stop when r reaches one.</span> <span m='340000'>But what about theta? Well,
  the first ray that we</span> <span m='343000'>might want to consider is the one
  that goes along the x-axis.</span> <span m='348000'>That is when theta equals zero.
  And we will stop when theta</span> <span m='351000'>reaches pi over two because
  we don't care about the rest of the</span> <span m='355000'>disk. We only care about
  the first</span> <span m='360000'>quadrant. We will stop at pi over two.</span>
  <span m='365000'>Now, there is a catch, though, which is that dA is not</span> <span
  m='371000'>dr d theta. Let me explain to you why.</span> <span m='375000'>Let's
  say that we are slicing. What it means is we are cutting</span> <span m='379000'>our
  region into little pieces that are the elementary,</span> <span m='384000'>you know,
  what corresponds to a small</span> <span m='386000'>rectangle in the x, y coordinate
  system,</span> <span m='388000'>here would be actually a little piece of circle
  between a given</span> <span m='396000'>radius r and r plus delta r. And given between
  an angle</span> <span m='402000'>theta and theta plus delta theta.</span> <span
  m='404000'>I need to draw, actually, a bigger picture of</span> <span m='408000'>that
  because it makes it really hard to read.</span> <span m='413000'>Let's say that
  I fix an angle theta and a slightly different</span> <span m='418000'>one where
  I have added delta theta to it.</span> <span m='422000'>And let's say that I have
  a radius r and I add delta r to</span> <span m='431000'>it. Then I will have a little
  piece</span> <span m='434000'>of x, y plane that is in here. And I have to figure
  out what</span> <span m='440000'>is its area? What is delta A for this guy?</span>
  <span m='446000'>Well, let's see. This guy actually,</span> <span m='449000'>you
  know, if my delta r and delta theta are small enough,</span> <span m='453000'>it
  will almost look like a rectangle.</span> <span m='455000'>It is rotated, but it
  is basically a</span> <span m='457000'>rectangle. I mean these sides,</span> <span
  m='459000'>of course, are curvy, but they are short enough and</span> <span m='464000'>it
  is almost straight. The area here should be this</span> <span m='470000'>length
  times that length. Well, what is this length?</span> <span m='475000'>That one is
  easy. It is delta r.</span> <span m='480000'>What about that length? Well, it is
  not delta theta.</span> <span m='483000'>It is something slightly different.</span>
  <span m='485000'>It is a piece of a circle of radius r corresponding to angle</span>
  <span m='493000'>delta theta, so it is r delta theta.</span> <span m='498000'>So,
  times r delta theta. That means now,</span> <span m='506000'>even if we shrink things
  and take smaller and smaller</span> <span m='512000'>regions, dA is going to be
  r dr d theta.</span> <span m='517000'>That is an important thing to remember.</span>
  <span m='518000'>When you integrate in polar coordinates, you just set up</span>
  <span m='524000'>your bounds in terms of r and theta, but you replace dA by r</span>
  <span m='530000'>dr d theta, not just dr d theta. And then, of course,</span> <span
  m='535000'>we have some function that we are integrating.</span> <span m='537000'>Let's
  say that I call that thing f then it is the same f</span> <span m='546000'>that
  I put up here. Concretely, how do I do it here?</span> <span m='552000'>Well, my
  function f was given as one minus x squared minus y</span> <span m='558000'>squared.
  And I would like to switch that</span> <span m='560000'>to polar coordinates. I
  want to put r and theta in</span> <span m='564000'>there. Well, I have formulas
  for x and</span> <span m='566000'>y in polar coordinates so I could just replace
  x squared by</span> <span m='570000'>r squared cosine squared theta, y squared by
  r squared sine</span> <span m='574000'>squared theta. And that works just fine.</span>
  <span m='577000'>But maybe you can observe that this is x squared plus y</span>
  <span m='584000'>squared. It is just the square of a</span> <span m='586000'>distance
  from the origin, so that is just r squared.</span> <span m='589000'>That is a useful
  thing. You don't strictly need it,</span> <span m='592000'>but it is much faster
  if you see this right away.</span> <span m='596000'>It saves you writing down a
  sine and a cosine.</span> <span m='607000'>Now we just end up with the integral
  from zero to pi over</span> <span m='613000'>two, integral from zero to one of one
  minus r squared r dr d</span> <span m='620000'>theta. Now, if I want to compute
  this</span> <span m='624000'>integral, so let's first do the inner integral.</span>
  <span m='630000'>If I integrate r minus r cubed, I will get r squared over two</span>
  <span m='637000'>minus r squared over four between zero and one.</span> <span m='643000'>And
  then I will integrate d theta.</span> <span m='647000'>What is this equal to? Well,
  for r equals one you get</span> <span m='651000'>one-half minus one-quarter, which
  is going to be just</span> <span m='654000'>one-quarter. And when you plug in zero
  you</span> <span m='656000'>get zero. So, it is the integral from</span> <span m='659000'>zero
  to pi over two of one-quarter d theta.</span> <span m='662000'>And that just integrates
  to one-quarter times pi over two,</span> <span m='671000'>which is pi over eight.
  That is a lot easier than the</span> <span m='678000'>way we did it yesterday. Well,
  here we were lucky.</span> <span m='683000'>I mean usually you will switch to polar
  coordinates either</span> <span m='686000'>because the region is easier to set up.</span>
  <span m='688000'>Here it is indeed easier to set up because the bounds became</span>
  <span m='691000'>very simple. We don't have that square root</span> <span m='694000'>of
  one minus x squared anymore. Or because the integrant</span> <span m='698000'>becomes
  much simpler. Here our function,</span> <span m='700000'>well, it is not very complicated
  in x,</span> <span m='703000'>y coordinates, but it is even simpler in r</span>
  <span m='706000'>theta coordinates. Here we were very lucky.</span> <span m='710000'>In
  general, there is maybe a trade off.</span> <span m='712000'>Maybe it will be easier
  to set up bounds but maybe the function</span> <span m='715000'>will become harder
  because it will have all these sines and</span> <span m='718000'>cosines in it.
  If our function had been just</span> <span m='721000'>x, x is very easy in x, y
  coordinates.</span> <span m='724000'>Here it becomes r cosine theta. That means
  you will have a</span> <span m='728000'>little bit of trig to do in the integral.</span>
  <span m='730000'>Not a very big one, not a very complicated</span> <span m='734000'>integral,
  but imagine it could get potentially much harder.</span> <span m='741000'>Anyway,
  that is double integrals in polar coordinates.</span> <span m='745000'>And the way
  you set up the bounds in general,</span> <span m='750000'>well, in 99% of the cases
  you will integrate over r first.</span> <span m='757000'>What you will do is you
  will look for a given theta what are</span> <span m='760000'>the bounds of r to
  be in the region.</span> <span m='762000'>What is the portion of my ray that is
  in the given region?</span> <span m='766000'>And then you will put bounds for theta.</span>
  <span m='769000'>But conceptually it is the same as before.</span> <span m='771000'>Instead
  of slicing horizontally or vertically,</span> <span m='775000'>we slice radially.
  We will do more examples in a</span> <span m='779000'>bit. Any questions about this
  or the</span> <span m='783000'>general method? Yes?</span> <span m='801000'>That
  is a very good question. Why do I measure the length</span> <span m='807000'>inside
  instead of outside? Which one do I want?</span> <span m='810000'>This one. Here
  I said this side is r</span> <span m='814000'>delta theta. I could have said,</span>
  <span m='816000'>actually, r delta theta is the length here.</span> <span m='818000'>Here
  it is slightly more, r plus delta r times delta</span> <span m='821000'>theta. But,
  if delta r is very small</span> <span m='823000'>compared to r, then that is almost
  the same</span> <span m='826000'>thing. And this is an approximation</span> <span
  m='828000'>anyway. I took this one because it</span> <span m='831000'>gives me the
  simpler formula. If you take the limit as delta</span> <span m='836000'>r turns
  to zero then the two things become the same anyway.</span> <span m='841000'>The
  length, whether you put r or r plus delta r in here,</span> <span m='844000'>doesn't
  matter anymore. If you imagine that this guy is</span> <span m='849000'>infinitely
  small then, really, the lengths become the</span> <span m='855000'>same. We will
  also see another proof</span> <span m='857000'>of this formula, using changes of
  variables,</span> <span m='860000'>next week. But, I mean,</span> <span m='863000'>hopefully
  this is at least slightly convincing.</span> <span m='868000'>More questions? No.</span>
  <span m='874000'>OK. Let's see.</span> <span m='880000'>We have seen how to compute
  double integrals.</span> <span m='882000'>I have to tell you what they are good
  for as well.</span> <span m='889000'>The definition we saw yesterday and the motivation
  was in terms</span> <span m='893000'>of finding volumes, but that is not going to
  be our</span> <span m='897000'>main preoccupation. Because finding volumes is fun</span>
  <span m='900000'>but that is not all there is to life.</span> <span m='902000'>I
  mean, you are doing single integrals.</span> <span m='905000'>When you do single
  integrals it is usually not to find the area</span> <span m='908000'>of some region
  of a plane. It is for something else</span> <span m='913000'>usually. The way we
  actually think of</span> <span m='916000'>the double integral is really as summing
  the values of a function</span> <span m='919000'>all around this region. We can
  use that to get</span> <span m='922000'>information about maybe the region or about
  the average</span> <span m='926000'>value of a function in that region and so on.</span>
  <span m='929000'>Let's think about various uses of double integrals.</span> <span
  m='939000'>The first one that I will mention is actually something</span> <span
  m='943000'>you thought maybe you could do with a single integral,</span> <span m='947000'>but
  it is useful very often to do it as a double integral.</span> <span m='951000'>It
  is to find the area of a given region r.</span> <span m='959000'>I give you some
  region in the plane and you want to know just</span> <span m='966000'>its area.
  In various cases,</span> <span m='968000'>you could set this up as a single integral,</span>
  <span m='972000'>but often it could be useful to set it up as a double integral.</span>
  <span m='976000'>How do you express the area as a double integral?</span> <span
  m='980000'>Well, the area of this region is the sum of the areas of all</span> <span
  m='982000'>the little pieces. It means you want to sum one dA</span> <span m='988000'>of
  the entire region. The area R is the double</span> <span m='997000'>integral over
  R of a function one.</span> <span m='1006000'>One way to think about it, if you
  are really still</span> <span m='1008000'>attached to the idea of double integral
  as a volume,</span> <span m='1011000'>what this measures is the volume below the
  graph of a</span> <span m='1014000'>function one. The graph of a function one is</span>
  <span m='1016000'>just a horizontal plane at height one.</span> <span m='1019000'>What
  you would be measuring is the volume of a prism with base</span> <span m='1027000'>r
  and height one. And the volume of that would</span> <span m='1031000'>be, of course,
  base times height.</span> <span m='1032000'>It would just be the area of r again.</span>
  <span m='1036000'>But we don't actually need to think about it that way.</span>
  <span m='1038000'>Really, what we are doing is summing dA over the entire</span>
  <span m='1044000'>region. A related thing we can do,</span> <span m='1048000'>imagine
  that, actually, this is some physical</span> <span m='1053000'>object. I mean, it
  has to be a flat</span> <span m='1055000'>object because we are just dealing with
  things in the plane</span> <span m='1058000'>so far. But you have a flat metal plate</span>
  <span m='1061000'>or something and you would like to know its mass.</span> <span
  m='1065000'>Well, its mass is the sum of the masses of every single</span> <span
  m='1070000'>little piece. You would get that by</span> <span m='1072000'>integrating
  the density. The density for a flat object</span> <span m='1077000'>would be the
  mass per unit area. So, you can get the mass of a</span> <span m='1089000'>flat
  object with density. Let's use delta for density,</span> <span m='1103000'>which
  is the mass per unit area.</span> <span m='1109000'>Each little piece of your object
  will have a mass,</span> <span m='1114000'>which will be just the density, times
  its area for each small</span> <span m='1120000'>piece. And you will get the total
  mass</span> <span m='1125000'>by summing these things. The mass will be the double</span>
  <span m='1131000'>integral of the density times the area element.</span> <span m='1136000'>Now,
  if it has constant density,</span> <span m='1138000'>if it is always the same material
  then,</span> <span m='1140000'>of course, you could just take the density</span>
  <span m='1143000'>out and you will get density times the total area if you know</span>
  <span m='1147000'>that it is always the same material.</span> <span m='1150000'>But
  if, actually, it has varying density maybe</span> <span m='1153000'>because it is
  some metallic thing with various metals or</span> <span m='1157000'>with varying
  thickness or something then you can still get</span> <span m='1161000'>the mass
  by integrating the density.</span> <span m='1164000'>Of course, looking at flat
  objects might be a little bit</span> <span m='1166000'>strange. That is because
  we are only</span> <span m='1168000'>doing double integrals so far. In a few weeks,</span>
  <span m='1170000'>we will be triple integrals. And then we will be able to do</span>
  <span m='1173000'>solids in space, but one thing at a time.</span> <span m='1195000'>Another
  useful application is to find the average value of</span> <span m='1208000'>some
  quantity in a region. What does it mean to take the</span> <span m='1216000'>average
  value of some function f in this region r?</span> <span m='1219000'>Well, you know
  what the average of a finite set of data is.</span> <span m='1222000'>For example,
  if I asked you to compute your</span> <span m='1224000'>average score on 18.02 problem
  sets,</span> <span m='1226000'>you would just take the scores, add them and divide
  by the</span> <span m='1230000'>number of problem sets. What if there are infinitely</span>
  <span m='1233000'>many things? Say I ask you to find the</span> <span m='1235000'>average
  temperature in this room.</span> <span m='1237000'>Well, you would have to measure
  the temperature everywhere.</span> <span m='1239000'>And then add all of these together
  and divide by the</span> <span m='1242000'>number of data points. But, depending
  on how careful</span> <span m='1245000'>you are, actually, there are potentially</span>
  <span m='1247000'>infinitely many points to look at.</span> <span m='1249000'>The
  mathematical way to define the average of a continuous set</span> <span m='1254000'>of
  data is that you actually integrate the function over the</span> <span m='1258000'>entire
  set of data, and then you divide by the size</span> <span m='1262000'>of the sample,
  which is just the area of the</span> <span m='1266000'>region. In fact, the average
  of f,</span> <span m='1270000'>the notation we will use usually for that is f with
  a bar</span> <span m='1277000'>on top to tell us it is the average f.</span> <span
  m='1283000'>We say we will take the integral of f and we will divide</span> <span
  m='1291000'>by the area of the region. You can really think of it as</span> <span
  m='1298000'>the sum of the values of f everywhere divided by the number</span> <span
  m='1304000'>of points everywhere. And so that is an average where</span> <span m='1308000'>everything
  is, actually, equally likely.</span> <span m='1311000'>That is a uniform average
  where all the points on the region,</span> <span m='1315000'>all the little points
  of the region are equally likely.</span> <span m='1319000'>But maybe if want to
  do, say, an average of some solid</span> <span m='1322000'>with variable density
  or if you want to somehow give more</span> <span m='1326000'>importance to certain
  parts than to others then you can actually</span> <span m='1330000'>do a weighted
  average. What is a weighted average?</span> <span m='1334000'>Well, in the case
  of taking the</span> <span m='1341000'>average your problem sets, if I tell you
  problem set one</span> <span m='1343000'>is worth twice as much as the others,</span>
  <span m='1345000'>then you would count twice that score in the sum and then you</span>
  <span m='1349000'>would count it as two, of course, when you divide.</span> <span
  m='1353000'>The weighted average is the sum of the values,</span> <span m='1356000'>but
  each weighted by a certain coefficient.</span> <span m='1359000'>And then you will
  divide by the sum of the weight.</span> <span m='1363000'>It is a bit the same idea
  as when we replace area by some</span> <span m='1368000'>mass that tells you how
  important a given piece.</span> <span m='1373000'>We will actually have a density.
  Let's call it delta again.</span> <span m='1382000'>We will see what we divide by,
  but what we will take is the</span> <span m='1387000'>integral of a function times
  the density times the area element.</span> <span m='1393000'>Because this would
  correspond to the mass element telling us</span> <span m='1398000'>how to weight
  the various points of our region.</span> <span m='1402000'>And then we would divide
  by the total weight,</span> <span m='1407000'>which is the mass of a region, as
  defined up there.</span> <span m='1414000'>If a density is uniform then, of course,
  the density gets out</span> <span m='1419000'>and you can simplify and reduce to
  that if all the points are</span> <span m='1424000'>equally likely. Why is that
  important?</span> <span m='1427000'>Well, that is important for various applications.</span>
  <span m='1429000'>But one that you might have seen in physics,</span> <span m='1433000'>we
  care about maybe where is the center of mass of a given</span> <span m='1438000'>object?
  The center of mass is basically</span> <span m='1441000'>a point that you would
  say is right in the middle of the</span> <span m='1445000'>object. But, of course,</span>
  <span m='1446000'>if the object has a very strange shape or if somehow part</span>
  <span m='1450000'>of it is heavier than the rest then that takes a very different</span>
  <span m='1454000'>meaning. Strictly speaking,</span> <span m='1457000'>the center
  of mass of a solid is the point where you would</span> <span m='1460000'>have to
  concentrate all the mass if you wanted it to behave</span> <span m='1464000'>equivalently
  from a point of view of mechanics,</span> <span m='1468000'>if you are trying to
  do translations of that object.</span> <span m='1471000'>If you are going to push
  that object that would be really</span> <span m='1477000'>where the equivalent point
  mass would lie.</span> <span m='1482000'>The other way to think about it,</span>
  <span m='1484000'>if I had a flat object then the center of mass would basically</span>
  <span m='1487000'>be the point where I would need to hold it so it is perfectly</span>
  <span m='1490000'>balanced. And, of course,</span> <span m='1492000'>I cannot do
  this. Well, you get the idea.</span> <span m='1496000'>And the center of mass of
  this eraser is somewhere in the</span> <span m='1499000'>middle. And so, in principle,</span>
  <span m='1500000'>that is where I would have to put my finger for it to stay.</span>
  <span m='1503000'>Well, it doesn't work. But that is where the center of</span>
  <span m='1511000'>mass should be. I think it should be in the</span> <span m='1519000'>middle.
  Maybe I shouldn't call this</span> <span m='1522000'>three. I should call this 2a,</span>
  <span m='1525000'>because it is really a special case of the average value.</span>
  <span m='1531000'>How do we find the center of mass of a flat object with</span>
  <span m='1547000'>density delta. If you have your object in the</span> <span m='1557000'>x,
  y plane then its center of mass</span> <span m='1560000'>will be at positions that
  are actually just the coordinates of</span> <span m='1563000'>a center of mass,
  will just be weighted averages</span> <span m='1569000'>of x and y on the solid.
  So, the center of mass will be</span> <span m='1574000'>a position that I will call
  x bar, y bar.</span> <span m='1577000'>And these are really just the averages, the
  average values of</span> <span m='1581000'>x and of y in the solid. Just to give
  you the formulas</span> <span m='1586000'>again, x bar would be one over the mass
  times the double</span> <span m='1593000'>integral of x times density dA. And the
  same thing with y.</span> <span m='1602000'>y bar is the weighted average of a y
  coordinate in your</span> <span m='1613000'>region. You see, if you take a region</span>
  <span m='1616000'>that is symmetric and has uniform density that will just</span>
  <span m='1619000'>give you the center of the region.</span> <span m='1621000'>But
  if the region has a strange shape or if a density is not</span> <span m='1625000'>homogeneous,
  if parts of it are heavier then</span> <span m='1628000'>you will get whatever the
  weighted average will be.</span> <span m='1632000'>And that will be the point where
  this thing would be</span> <span m='1635000'>balanced if you were trying to balance
  it on a pole or on your</span> <span m='1639000'>finger.</span> <span m='1676000'>Any
  questions so far? Yes.</span> <span m='1692000'>No. Here I didn't set this up as
  a</span> <span m='1698000'>iterated integral yet. The function that I am</span>
  <span m='1703000'>integrating is x times delta where density will be given to</span>
  <span m='1708000'>me maybe as a function of x and y.</span> <span m='1710000'>And
  then I will integrate this dA.</span> <span m='1713000'>And dA could mean dx over
  dy, it could mean dy over dx,</span> <span m='1716000'>it could be mean r dr d theta.
  I will choose how to set it up</span> <span m='1720000'>depending maybe on the shape
  of the region.</span> <span m='1723000'>If my solid is actually just going to be
  round then I might</span> <span m='1726000'>want to use polar coordinates. If it
  is a square,</span> <span m='1729000'>I might want to use x, y coordinates.</span>
  <span m='1731000'>If it is more complicated, well, I will choose depending</span>
  <span m='1736000'>on how I feel about it. Yes?</span> <span m='1741000'>Delta is
  the density. In general, it is a function of</span> <span m='1745000'>x and y. If
  you imagine that your solid</span> <span m='1748000'>is not homogenous then its
  density will depend on which</span> <span m='1751000'>piece of it you are looking
  at. Of course, to compute this,</span> <span m='1755000'>you need to know the density.
  If you have a problem asking</span> <span m='1758000'>you to find the center of
  mass of something and you have no</span> <span m='1760000'>information about the
  density, assume it is uniform.</span> <span m='1763000'>Take the density to be a
  constant.</span> <span m='1766000'>Even take it to be a one. That is even easier.</span>
  <span m='1769000'>I mean it is a general fact of math.</span> <span m='1770000'>We
  don't care about units. If density is constant,</span> <span m='1774000'>we might
  as well take it to be one.</span> <span m='1776000'>That just means our mass unit
  becomes the area unit.</span> <span m='1781000'>Yes? That is a good question.</span>
  <span m='1793000'>No, I don't think we could actually find the center of mass</span>
  <span m='1797000'>in polar coordinates by finding the average of R or the average</span>
  <span m='1800000'>of theta. For example,</span> <span m='1802000'>take a disk center
  at the origin, well,</span> <span m='1805000'>the center of mass should be at the
  origin.</span> <span m='1809000'>But the average of R is certainly not zero because
  R is</span> <span m='1812000'>positive everywhere. So, that doesn't work.</span>
  <span m='1814000'>You cannot get the polar coordinates of a center of mass</span>
  <span m='1818000'>just by taking the average of R and the average of theta.</span>
  <span m='1821000'>By the way, what is the average of theta?</span> <span m='1823000'>If
  you take theta to from zero to 2pi, the average theta will</span> <span m='1826000'>be
  pi. If you take it to go from minus</span> <span m='1828000'>pi to pi, the average
  theta will be zero.</span> <span m='1830000'>So, there is a problem there. That
  actually just doesn't</span> <span m='1834000'>work, so we really have to compute
  x bar and y bar.</span> <span m='1838000'>But still we could set this up and then
  switch to polar</span> <span m='1841000'>coordinates to evaluate this integral.</span>
  <span m='1844000'>But we still would be computing the average values of x and y.</span>
  <span m='1858000'>We are basically re-exploring mechanics and motion of solids</span>
  <span m='1864000'>here. The next thing is moment of</span> <span m='1870000'>inertia.
  Just to remind you or in case</span> <span m='1875000'>you somehow haven't seen
  it in physics yet,</span> <span m='1878000'>the moment of inertia is basically to
  rotation of a solid</span> <span m='1883000'>where the mass is to translation.</span>
  <span m='1886000'>In the following sense, the mass of a solid is what</span> <span
  m='1890000'>makes it hard to push it. How hard it is to throw</span> <span m='1894000'>something
  is related to its mass.</span> <span m='1896000'>How hard it is to spin something,
  on the other hand,</span> <span m='1901000'>is given by its moment of inertia.</span>
  <span m='1904000'>Maybe I should write this down. Mass is how hard it is to</span>
  <span m='1911000'>impart a translation motion to a solid.</span> <span m='1919000'>I
  am using fancy words today. And the moment of inertia --</span> <span m='1926000'>The
  difference with a mass is that the moment of inertia is</span> <span m='1933000'>defined
  about some axis. You choose an axis.</span> <span m='1937000'>Then you would try
  to measure how hard it is to spin your</span> <span m='1939000'>object around that
  axis. For example,</span> <span m='1941000'>you can try to measure how hard it is
  to spin this sheet of</span> <span m='1944000'>paper about an axis that is in the
  center of it.</span> <span m='1947000'>We would try to spin it light that and see
  how much effort I</span> <span m='1950000'>would have to make. Well, for a sheet
  of paper not</span> <span m='1955000'>very much. That would measure the same</span>
  <span m='1963000'>thing but it would be rotation motion about that axis.</span>
  <span m='1978000'>Maybe some of you know the definition but I am going to try</span>
  <span m='1982000'>to derive it again. I am sorry but it won't be as</span> <span
  m='1985000'>quite as detailed as the way you have probably seen it in</span> <span
  m='1987000'>physics, but I am not trying to replace your physics teachers.</span>
  <span m='1989000'>I am sure they are doing a great job.</span> <span m='1996000'>What
  is the idea for the definition to find a formula for</span> <span m='1999000'>moment
  of inertia? The idea is to think about</span> <span m='2001000'>kinetic energy.
  Kinetic energy is really when</span> <span m='2004000'>you push something or when
  you try to make it move and you have</span> <span m='2008000'>to put some inertia
  to it. Then it has kinetic energy.</span> <span m='2012000'>And then, if you have
  the right device, you can convert back</span> <span m='2018000'>that kinetic energy
  into something else.</span> <span m='2021000'>If you try to look at the kinetic
  energy of a point mass,</span> <span m='2026000'>so you have something with mass
  m going at the velocity v,</span> <span m='2033000'>well, that will be one-half
  of a mass times the square of the</span> <span m='2037000'>speed. I hope you have
  all seen that</span> <span m='2040000'>formula some time before. Now, let's say
  instead of just</span> <span m='2044000'>trying to push this mass, I am going to
  make it spin</span> <span m='2047000'>around something. Instead of just somewhere,</span>
  <span m='2052000'>maybe I will have the origin, and I am trying to make it go</span>
  <span m='2060000'>around the origin in a circle at a certain angular velocity.</span>
  <span m='2069000'>For a mass m at distance r, let's call r this distance.</span>
  <span m='2080000'>And angular velocity, let's call the angular velocity</span> <span
  m='2087000'>omega. I think that is what physicists</span> <span m='2090000'>call
  it. Remember angular velocity is</span> <span m='2093000'>just the rate of the change
  of the angle over time.</span> <span m='2097000'>It is d theta dt, if you want.
  Well, what is the kinetic</span> <span m='2102000'>energy now? Well, first we have
  to find out</span> <span m='2105000'>what the speed is. What is the speed?</span>
  <span m='2107000'>Well, if we are going on a circle of</span> <span m='2110000'>radius
  r at angular velocity omega that means that in unit</span> <span m='2116000'>time
  we rotate by omega and we go by a distance of r times</span> <span m='2122000'>omega.
  The actual speed is the radius</span> <span m='2126000'>times angular velocity.
  And so the kinetic energy is</span> <span m='2132000'>one-half mv squared, which
  is one-half m r squared</span> <span m='2138000'>omega squared. And so,</span> <span
  m='2141000'>by similarity with that formula,</span> <span m='2147000'>the coefficient
  of v squared is the mass,</span> <span m='2151000'>and here we will say the coefficient
  of omega squared,</span> <span m='2153000'>so this thing is the moment of inertia.</span>
  <span m='2157000'>That is how we define moment of inertia.</span> <span m='2176000'>Now,
  that is only for a point mass.</span> <span m='2180000'>And it is kind of fun to
  spin just a small bowl,</span> <span m='2183000'>but maybe you would like to spin
  actually a larger solid and</span> <span m='2186000'>try to define this moment of
  inertia.</span> <span m='2189000'>Well, the moment inertia of a solid will be just
  the sum of</span> <span m='2193000'>the moments of inertia of all the little pieces.</span>
  <span m='2196000'>What we will do is just cut our solid into little chunks and</span>
  <span m='2205000'>will sum this thing for each little piece.</span> <span m='2211000'>For
  a solid with density delta, each little piece has mass</span> <span m='2220000'>which
  is the density times the amount of area.</span> <span m='2227000'>This is equal
  actually. And the moment of inertia of</span> <span m='2232000'>that small portion
  of a solid will be delta m,</span> <span m='2236000'>the small mass, times r squared,</span>
  <span m='2238000'>the square of a distance to the center of the axis along which
  I</span> <span m='2245000'>am spinning. That means if I sum these</span> <span m='2249000'>things
  together, well, it has moment of inertia</span> <span m='2255000'>delta m times
  r squared, which is r squared times the</span> <span m='2262000'>density times delta
  A. And so I will be summing these</span> <span m='2268000'>things together. And
  so, the moment of inertia</span> <span m='2272000'>about the origin will be the
  double integral of r squared</span> <span m='2276000'>times density times dA.</span>
  <span m='2308000'>The final formula for the moment of inertia about the</span> <span
  m='2316000'>origin is the double integral of a region of r squared density</span>
  <span m='2326000'>dA. If you are going to do it in x,</span> <span m='2328000'>y
  coordinates, of course, r squared becomes x</span> <span m='2331000'>squared plus
  y squared, it is the square of the</span> <span m='2336000'>distance from the origin.
  When you integrate this,</span> <span m='2342000'>that tells you how hard it is
  to spin that solid about the</span> <span m='2345000'>origin. The motion that we
  try to do --</span> <span m='2349000'>We keep this fixed and then we just rotate
  around the origin.</span> <span m='2355000'>Sorry. That is a pretty bad picture,</span>
  <span m='2360000'>but hopefully you know what I mean.</span> <span m='2366000'>And
  the name we use for that is I0.</span> <span m='2369000'>And then the rotational
  kinetic energy is one-half times this</span> <span m='2377000'>moment of inertia
  times the square of the angular velocity.</span> <span m='2386000'>So that shows
  as that this replaces the mass for rotation</span> <span m='2394000'>motions. OK.</span>
  <span m='2397000'>What about other kinds of rotations?</span> <span m='2403000'>In
  particular, we have been rotating things</span> <span m='2406000'>about just a point
  in the plane. What you could imagine also is</span> <span m='2413000'>instead you
  have your solid. What I have done so far is I</span> <span m='2419000'>have skewered
  it this way, and I am rotating around the</span> <span m='2422000'>axis. Instead,
  I could skewer it</span> <span m='2425000'>through, say, the horizontal axis.</span>
  <span m='2427000'>And then I could try to spin about the horizontal axis so</span>
  <span m='2436000'>then it would rotate in space in that direction like that.</span>
  <span m='2446000'>Let's say we do rotation about the x-axis.</span> <span m='2451000'>Well,
  the idea would still be the same.</span> <span m='2453000'>The moment of inertia
  for any small piece of a solid would be</span> <span m='2458000'>its mass element
  times the square of a distance to the x</span> <span m='2462000'>axes because that
  will be the radius of a trajectory.</span> <span m='2466000'>If you take this point
  here, it is going to go in a circle</span> <span m='2472000'>like that centered
  on the x-axis.</span> <span m='2476000'>So the radius will just be this distance
  here.</span> <span m='2481000'>Well, what is this distance? It is just y,</span>
  <span m='2484000'>or maybe absolute value of y. Distance to x-axis is absolute</span>
  <span m='2494000'>value of y. What we actually care about is</span> <span m='2499000'>the
  square of a distance, so it will just be y squared.</span> <span m='2504000'>The
  moment of inertia about the x-axis is going to be obtained</span> <span m='2511000'>by
  integrating y squared times the mass element.</span> <span m='2517000'>It is slightly
  strange but I have y in inertia about the</span> <span m='2520000'>x-axis. But,
  if you think about it,</span> <span m='2523000'>y tells me how far I am from the
  x-axis, so how hard it will</span> <span m='2527000'>be to spin around the x-axis.
  And I could do the same about</span> <span m='2531000'>any axis that I want. Just
  I would have to sum the</span> <span m='2537000'>square of a distance to the axis
  of rotation.</span> <span m='2543000'>Maybe I should do an example. Yes?</span>
  <span m='2551000'>Same thing as above, distance to the x-axis,</span> <span m='2556000'>because
  that is what we care about.</span> <span m='2559000'>For the moment of inertia,
  we want the square of a</span> <span m='2567000'>distance to the axis of rotation.</span>
  <span m='2572000'>Let's do an example. Let's try to figure out if we</span> <span
  m='2577000'>have just a uniform disk how hard it is to spin it around its</span>
  <span m='2583000'>center. That shouldn't be very hard to</span> <span m='2588000'>figure
  out. Say that we have a disk of</span> <span m='2596000'>radius a and we want to
  rotate it about its center.</span> <span m='2609000'>And let's say that it is of
  uniform density.</span> <span m='2612000'>And let's take just the density to be
  a one so that we don't</span> <span m='2616000'>really care about the density. What
  is the moment of inertia</span> <span m='2620000'>of that? Well, we have to integrate
  of</span> <span m='2625000'>our disk r squared times the density, which is one,</span>
  <span m='2631000'>times dA. What is r squared?</span> <span m='2635000'>You have
  here to resist the urge to say the radius is just</span> <span m='2638000'>a. We
  know the radius is a.</span> <span m='2640000'>No, it is not a because we are looking
  at rotation of any point</span> <span m='2645000'>inside this disk. And, when you
  are inside the</span> <span m='2647000'>disk, the distance to the origin is not
  a.</span> <span m='2649000'>It is less than a. It is actually anything between</span>
  <span m='2653000'>zero and a. Just to point out a pitfall,</span> <span m='2656000'>r
  here is really a function on this disk.</span> <span m='2658000'>And we are going
  to integrate this function.</span> <span m='2660000'>Don't plug r equals a just
  yet. What coordinates do we use to</span> <span m='2668000'>compute this integral?
  They are probably polar</span> <span m='2671000'>coordinates, unless you want a
  repeat of what happened already</span> <span m='2675000'>with x and y. That will
  tell us we want to</span> <span m='2679000'>integrate r squared time r dr d theta.</span>
  <span m='2682000'>And the bounds for r, well, r will go from zero to a.</span> <span
  m='2687000'>No matter which direction I go from the origin,</span> <span m='2691000'>if
  I fixed it, r goes from zero to r equals a.</span> <span m='2696000'>The part of
  this ray that lives inside the disk is always from</span> <span m='2702000'>zero
  to a. And theta goes from,</span> <span m='2705000'>well, zero to 2 pi for example.
  And now you can compute this</span> <span m='2711000'>integral. Well, I will let
  you figure it</span> <span m='2714000'>out. But the inner integral becomes</span>
  <span m='2718000'>a to the four over four and the outer multiplies things by 2pi,</span>
  <span m='2725000'>so you get pi a to the four over two.</span> <span m='2730000'>OK.
  That is how hard it is to spin</span> <span m='2733000'>this disk. Now, what about
  instead of</span> <span m='2737000'>spinning it about the center we decided to spin
  it about a point</span> <span m='2743000'>on a second point. For example, think
  of a Frisbee.</span> <span m='2746000'>A Frisbee has this rim so you can actually
  try to make it</span> <span m='2750000'>rotate around the point on the circumference
  by holding it near</span> <span m='2755000'>the rim and spinning it there. How much
  harder is that than</span> <span m='2759000'>around the center? Well, we will try
  to compute</span> <span m='2762000'>now the moment of inertia about this point.</span>
  <span m='2765000'>We have two options. One is we keep the system of</span> <span
  m='2768000'>coordinates centers here. But then the formula for</span> <span m='2772000'>distance
  to this point becomes harder.</span> <span m='2775000'>The other option, which is
  the one I will choose,</span> <span m='2778000'>is to change the coordinate so that
  this point become the</span> <span m='2781000'>origin. Let's do that.</span> <span
  m='2810000'>About a point on the circumference,</span> <span m='2818000'>what I
  would have to do maybe is set up my region like that.</span> <span m='2833000'>I
  have moved the origin so that it is on the circumference of a</span> <span m='2837000'>disk,
  and I will again try to find</span> <span m='2841000'>the moment of inertia of this
  disk about the origin.</span> <span m='2847000'>It is still, for the the double
  integral of</span> <span m='2851000'>r squared dA. But now I want to find out how</span>
  <span m='2856000'>to set up the integral. I could try to use x,</span> <span m='2860000'>y
  coordinates and it would work.</span> <span m='2863000'>Or I can use polar coordinates,
  and it works a little bit</span> <span m='2867000'>better that way. But both are
  doable.</span> <span m='2872000'>Let's say I do it this way. I have to figure out
  how to set</span> <span m='2876000'>up my bounds. What are the bounds for r?</span>
  <span m='2880000'>Well, if I fix a value for theta, which means I chose an</span>
  <span m='2886000'>angle here, now I am shooting a ray from the origin in that</span>
  <span m='2892000'>direction. I enter my region at r equals</span> <span m='2896000'>zero.
  That hasn't changed.</span> <span m='2899000'>The question is where do I exit the
  region?</span> <span m='2903000'>What is that distance? Maybe you have seen it in</span>
  <span m='2913000'>recitation, maybe not. Let's see.</span> <span m='2917000'>Actually,
  I should have written down the radius of a circle is</span> <span m='2920000'>a.
  So this distance here is 2a.</span> <span m='2927000'>If you draw this segment in
  here, you know that here you</span> <span m='2932000'>have a right angle. You have
  a right triangle.</span> <span m='2936000'>The hypotenuse here has length 2a.</span>
  <span m='2939000'>This angle is theta. Well, this length is 2a cosine</span> <span
  m='2948000'>theta. The polar coordinates equation</span> <span m='2954000'>of this
  circle passing through the origin is r equals 2a cosine</span> <span m='2962000'>theta.
  So, r will go from zero to 2a</span> <span m='2967000'>cosine theta. That is the
  distance here.</span> <span m='2973000'>Now, what are the bounds for theta?</span>
  <span m='2977000'>It is not quite zero to 2pi because, actually,</span> <span m='2979000'>you
  see in this direction, if I shoot a ray in this</span> <span m='2982000'>direction
  I will never meet my region.</span> <span m='2984000'>We have to actually think
  a bit more.</span> <span m='2987000'>Well, the directions in which I will actually
  hit my circle are</span> <span m='2992000'>all the directions in the right half
  of a plane.</span> <span m='2996000'>I mean, of course, if I shoot very close to
  the</span> <span m='2998000'>axis, you might think, oh, I won't be in there.</span>
  <span m='3000000'>But, actually, that is not true because here</span> <span m='3003000'>the
  circle is tangent to the axis.</span> <span m='3005000'>No matter which direction
  I take, I will still have a little</span> <span m='3009000'>tiny piece. The angle
  actually goes from</span> <span m='3013000'>minus pi over two to pi over two.</span>
  <span m='3015000'>If you compute that you will get,</span> <span m='3020000'>well,
  the inner integral will be r to the four over four</span> <span m='3025000'>between
  zero and 2a cosine theta,</span> <span m='3028000'>which will turn out to be 4a
  to the four cosine to the four</span> <span m='3034000'>theta. And now you will
  integrate that</span> <span m='3039000'>for minus pi over two to pi over two.</span>
  <span m='3043000'>And that is, again, the evil integral that</span> <span m='3047000'>we
  had yesterday. Either we remember the method</span> <span m='3050000'>from yesterday
  or we remember from yesterday that actually</span> <span m='3053000'>there are formulas
  in the notes to help you.</span> <span m='3056000'>On homework, you can use these
  formulas.</span> <span m='3058000'>In the notes at the beginning of section 3b there
  are formulas</span> <span m='3064000'>for these particular kinds of integrals.</span>
  <span m='3068000'>And that will end up being three-halves of pi a to the</span>
  <span m='3073000'>four. In case you wanted to know,</span> <span m='3075000'>it
  is three times harder to spin a Frisbee about a point on</span> <span m='3078000'>a
  circumference than around the center.</span> <span m='3080000'>We got three times
  the moment of inertia about the center.</span> <span m='3086000'>OK. That is it.</span>
  <span m='3087000'>Have a nice weekend.</span> </p>
