  at what happens when we</span> <span m=''35000''>have non-independent variables.
  So, I''m afraid we don''t take</span> <span m=''45000''>deliveries during class
  time, sorry.</span> <span m=''50000''>Please take a seat, thanks. [LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m=''60000''>[APPLAUSE] OK, so Jason,</span> <span m=''65000''>you please claim
  your package at the end of lecture.</span> <span m=''77000''>OK, so last time we
  saw how to use</span> <span m=''79000''>Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum
  or maximum of a function</span> <span m=''83000''>of several variables when the
  variables are not independent.</span> <span m=''87000''>And, today we''re going
  to try to figure out more about</span> <span m=''89000''>relations between the variables,
  and how to handle functions</span> <span m=''93000''>that depend on several variables
  when they''re related.</span> <span m=''96000''>So, just to give you an example,</span>
  <span m=''100000''>in physics, very often, you have functions that depend</span>
  <span m=''104000''>on pressure, volume, and temperature where pressure,</span> <span
  m=''109000''>volume, and temperature are actually</span> <span m=''112000''>not
  independent. But they are related,</span> <span m=''115000''>say, by PV=nRT. So,
  of course,</span> <span m=''118000''>then you can substitute and expressed a function
  in terms of</span> <span m=''121000''>two of them only, but very often it''s convenient</span>
  <span m=''124000''>to keep all three. But then we have to figure out,</span> <span
  m=''126000''>what are the rates of change with respect to t,</span> <span m=''131000''>with
  respect to each other, the rate of change of f with</span> <span m=''134000''>respect
  to these variables, and so on.</span> <span m=''136000''>So, we have to figure out
  what we mean by partial derivatives</span> <span m=''141000''>again. So,</span>
  <span m=''144000''>OK, more generally, let''s say just for the sake of</span> <span
  m=''151000''>notation, I''m going to think of a</span> <span m=''153000''>function
  of three variables, x, y, z,</span> <span m=''155000''>where the variables are related
  by some equation,</span> <span m=''159000''>but I will put in the form g of x, y,
  z equals some constant.</span> <span m=''164000''>OK, so that''s the same kind of
  setup as we had last time,</span> <span m=''168000''>except now we are not just
  looking for minima and maxima.</span> <span m=''172000''>We are trying to understand
  partial derivatives.</span> <span m=''179000''>So, the first observation is that
  if x, y,</span> <span m=''186000''>and z are related, then that means,</span> <span
  m=''189000''>in principle, we could solve for one of them,</span> <span m=''191000''>and
  express it as a function of the two others.</span> <span m=''195000''>So, in particular,
  can we understand even without</span> <span m=''199000''>solving? Maybe we can not
  solve.</span> <span m=''201000''>Can we understand how the variables are related
  to each</span> <span m=''207000''>other? So, for example,</span> <span m=''209000''>z,
  you can think of z as a function of x and y.</span> <span m=''213000''>So, we can
  ask ourselves, what are the rates of change of</span> <span m=''220000''>z with
  respect to x, keeping y constant,</span> <span m=''224000''>or with respect to y
  keeping x constant?</span> <span m=''229000''>And, of course, if we can solve,</span>
  <span m=''231000''>that we know the formula for this.</span> <span m=''233000''>And
  then we can compute these guys.</span> <span m=''235000''>But, what if we can''t
  solve? So, how do we find these things</span> <span m=''243000''>without solving?
  Well, so let''s do an example.</span> <span m=''251000''>Let''s say that my relation
  is x^2 yz z^3=8.</span> <span m=''259000''>And, let''s say that I''m looking near
  the point (x,</span> <span m=''264000''>y, z) equals (2,3, 1).</span> <span m=''267000''>So,
  let me check 2^2 plus three times one plus 1^3 is indeed</span> <span m=''273000''>eight.
  OK, but now,</span> <span m=''274000''>if I change x and y a little bit, how does
  z change?</span> <span m=''278000''>Well, of course I could solve for z in here.</span>
  <span m=''281000''>It''s a cubic equation. There is actually a formula.</span> <span
  m=''283000''>But that formula is quite complicated.</span> <span m=''285000''>We
  actually don''t want to do that.</span> <span m=''287000''>There''s an easier way.
  So, how can we do it?</span> <span m=''298000''>Well, let''s look at the differential
  -- -- of this</span> <span m=''307000''>constraint quantity. OK, so if we called
  this g,</span> <span m=''315000''>let''s look at dg. So, what''s the differential
  of</span> <span m=''321000''>this? So, the differential of x^2 is</span> <span m=''326000''>2x
  dx plus, I think there''s a zdy.</span> <span m=''332000''>There''s a ydz, and there''s
  also a 3z^2 dz.</span> <span m=''338000''>OK, you can get this either by implicit
  differentiation and the</span> <span m=''342000''>product rule, or you could get
  this just by</span> <span m=''345000''>putting here, here,</span> <span m=''346000''>and
  here the partial derivatives of this with respect</span> <span m=''351000''>to x,
  y, and z. OK, any questions about how I</span> <span m=''356000''>got this? No?</span>
  <span m=''358000''>OK. So, now, what do I do with this?</span> <span m=''363000''>Well,
  this represents, somehow, variations of g.</span> <span m=''367000''>But, well,
  I''ve set this thing equal to eight.</span> <span m=''372000''>And, eight is a constant.
  So, it doesn''t change.</span> <span m=''376000''>So, in fact, well, we can set
  this to zero</span> <span m=''386000''>because, well, they call this g.</span> <span
  m=''395000''>Then, g equals eight is constant.</span> <span m=''399000''>That means
  we set dg equal to zero.</span> <span m=''403000''>OK, so, now let''s just plug
  in some values at this point.</span> <span m=''413000''>That tells us, well, so
  if x equals two,</span> <span m=''418000''>that''s 4dx plus z is one. So, dy plus
  y 3z^2 should be</span> <span m=''427000''>6dz equals zero. And now, this equation,</span>
  <span m=''433000''>here, tells us about a relation between the changes in x,</span>
  <span m=''437000''>y, and z near that point. It tells us how you change x</span>
  <span m=''441000''>and y, well, how z will change. Or, it tells you actually</span>
  <span m=''445000''>anything you might want to know about the relations between</span>
  <span m=''448000''>these variables so, for example,</span> <span m=''450000''>you
  can move dz to that side, and then express dz in terms of</span> <span m=''454000''>dx
  and dy. Or, you can move dy to that</span> <span m=''457000''>side and express dy
  in terms of dx and dz, and so on.</span> <span m=''461000''>It tells you at the
  level of the derivatives how each of the</span> <span m=''466000''>variables depends
  on the two others.</span> <span m=''469000''>OK, so, just to clarify this: if we
  want to view z as a</span> <span m=''477000''>function of x and y, then what we
  will do is we will</span> <span m=''483000''>just move the dz''s to the other side,</span>
  <span m=''486000''>and it will tell us dz equals minus one over six times 4dx</span>
  <span m=''495000''>plus dy. And, so that should tell you</span> <span m=''500000''>that
  partial z over partial x is minus four over six.</span> <span m=''506000''>Well,
  that''s minus two thirds, and partial z over partial y is</span> <span m=''515000''>going
  to be minus one sixth. OK, another way to think about</span> <span m=''522000''>this:
  when we compute partial z over partial x,</span> <span m=''527000''>that means that
  actually we keep y constant.</span> <span m=''531000''>OK, let me actually add some
  subtitles here.</span> <span m=''535000''>So, here that means we keep y constant.</span>
  <span m=''540000''>And so, if we keep y constant, another way to think about it</span>
  <span m=''545000''>is we set dy to zero. We set dy equals zero.</span> <span m=''550000''>So
  if we do that, we get dx equals negative four</span> <span m=''554000''>sixths dx.
  That tells us the rate of</span> <span m=''557000''>change of z with respect to
  x. Here, we set x constant.</span> <span m=''564000''>So, that means we set dx equal
  to zero.</span> <span m=''569000''>And, if we set dx equal to zero, then we have
  dz equals</span> <span m=''572000''>negative one sixth of dy. That tells us the
  rate of</span> <span m=''576000''>change of z with respect to y. OK, any questions
  about that?</span> <span m=''587000''>No? What, yes?</span> <span m=''597000''>Yes,
  OK, let me explain that again.</span> <span m=''599000''>So we found an expression
  for dz in terms of dx and dy.</span> <span m=''603000''>That means that this thing,
  the differential,</span> <span m=''607000''>is the total differential of z viewed
  as a function of x and y.</span> <span m=''611000''>OK, and so the coefficients
  of dx and dy are the partials.</span> <span m=''616000''>Or, another way to think
  about it, if you want to know partial</span> <span m=''620000''>z partial x, it
  means you set y to be constant.</span> <span m=''622000''>Setting y to be constant
  means that you will put zero in the</span> <span m=''627000''>place of dy. So, you
  will be left with dz</span> <span m=''630000''>equals minus four sixths dx. And,
  that will give you the</span> <span m=''635000''>rate of change of z with respect
  to x when you keep y constant,</span> <span m=''641000''>OK? So, there are various
  ways to</span> <span m=''646000''>think about this, but hopefully it makes sense.</span>
  <span m=''653000''>OK, so how do we think about this in general?</span> <span m=''663000''>Well,
  if we know that g of x, y, z equals a constant,</span> <span m=''675000''>then dg,
  which is gxdx gydy gzdz should be set equal to</span> <span m=''687000''>zero. OK,
  and now we can solve for</span> <span m=''692000''>whichever variable we want to
  express in terms of the others.</span> <span m=''697000''>So, for example, if we
  care about z as a</span> <span m=''707000''>function of x and y -- -- we''ll get
  that dz is negative gx over</span> <span m=''722000''>gz dx minus gy over gz dy.
  And, so if we want partial z</span> <span m=''737000''>over partial x, well, so
  one way is just to say</span> <span m=''743000''>that''s going to be the coefficient
  of dx in here,</span> <span m=''746000''>or just to write down the other way.</span>
  <span m=''749000''>We are setting y equals constant.</span> <span m=''754000''>So,
  that means we set dy equal to zero.</span> <span m=''759000''>And then, we get dz
  equals negative gx over gz dx.</span> <span m=''768000''>So, that means partial
  z over partial x is minus gx over gz.</span> <span m=''776000''>And, see, that''s
  a very counterintuitive</span> <span m=''779000''>formula because you have this
  minus sign that you somehow</span> <span m=''782000''>probably couldn''t have seen
  come if you hadn''t actually derived</span> <span m=''786000''>things this way.
  I mean, it''s pretty surprising</span> <span m=''791000''>to see that minus sign
  come out of nowhere the first time you</span> <span m=''797000''>see it. OK, so
  now we know how to find</span> <span m=''802000''>the rate of change of constrained
  variables with</span> <span m=''806000''>respect to each other. You can apply the
  same to find,</span> <span m=''811000''>if you want partial x, partial y, or any
  of them,</span> <span m=''815000''>you can do it. Any questions so far?</span> <span
  m=''821000''>No? OK, so, before we proceed</span> <span m=''828000''>further, I
  should probably expose some problem with the</span> <span m=''835000''>notations
  that we have so far. So, let me try to get you a bit</span> <span m=''843000''>confused,
  OK? So, let''s take a very simple</span> <span m=''847000''>example. Let''s say
  I have a function,</span> <span m=''850000''>f of x, y equals x y. OK, so far it
  doesn''t sound</span> <span m=''855000''>very confusing. And then, I can write partial
  f</span> <span m=''860000''>over partial x. And, I think you all know how</span>
  <span m=''864000''>to compute it. It''s going to be just one.</span> <span m=''868000''>OK,
  so far we are pretty happy. Now let''s do a change of</span> <span m=''874000''>variables.
  Let''s set x=u and y=u v.</span> <span m=''884000''>It''s not very complicated change
  of variables.</span> <span m=''886000''>But let''s do it. Then, f in terms of u
  and v,</span> <span m=''894000''>well, so f, remember f was x y becomes u plus u
  plus v.</span> <span m=''902000''>That''s twice u plus v. What''s partial f over
  partial u?</span> <span m=''913000''>It''s two. So, x and u are the same thing.</span>
  <span m=''918000''>Partial f over partial x, and partial f over partial u,</span>
  <span m=''921000''>well, unless you believe that one equals two,</span> <span m=''924000''>they
  are really not the same thing, OK?</span> <span m=''926000''>So, that''s an interesting,
  slightly strange phenomenon.</span> <span m=''936000''>x equals u, but partial f
  partial x is not the same as</span> <span m=''946000''>partial f partial u. So,
  how do we get rid of this</span> <span m=''952000''>contradiction? Well, we have
  to think a bit</span> <span m=''955000''>more about what these notations mean, OK?</span>
  <span m=''959000''>So, when we write partial f over partial x,</span> <span m=''963000''>it
  means that we are varying x, keeping y constant.</span> <span m=''968000''>When
  we write partial f over partial u, it means we are</span> <span m=''971000''>varying
  u, keeping v constant. So, varying u or varying x is</span> <span m=''975000''>the
  same thing. But, keeping v constant,</span> <span m=''977000''>or keeping y constant
  are not the same thing.</span> <span m=''980000''>If I keep y constant, then when
  I change x,</span> <span m=''983000''>so when I change u, then v will also have
  to change</span> <span m=''987000''>so that their sum stays the same.</span> <span
  m=''989000''>Or, if you prefer the other way around, when I do this one I</span>
  <span m=''992000''>keep v constant. If I keep v constant and I</span> <span m=''995000''>change
  u, then y will change. It won''t be constant.</span> <span m=''999000''>So, that
  means, well, life looked quite nice</span> <span m=''1003000''>and easy with these
  notations. But, what''s dangerous about</span> <span m=''1009000''>them is they
  are not making explicit what it is exactly that</span> <span m=''1015000''>we are
  keeping constant. OK, so just to write things,</span> <span m=''1021000''>so here
  we change u and x that are the same thing.</span> <span m=''1028000''>But we keep
  y constant, while here we change u,</span> <span m=''1034000''>which is still the
  same thing as x.</span> <span m=''1039000''>But, what we keep constant is v, or
  in terms of x and y,</span> <span m=''1046000''>that''s y minus x constant. And,
  that''s why they are not</span> <span m=''1053000''>the same. So, whenever there''s
  any risk</span> <span m=''1056000''>of confusion, OK, so not in the cases that we</span>
  <span m=''1059000''>had before because what we''ve done until now,</span> <span
  m=''1062000''>we didn''t really have a problem. But, in a situation like this,</span>
  <span m=''1066000''>to clarify things, we''ll actually say explicitly</span> <span
  m=''1070000''>what it is that we want to keep constant.</span> <span m=''1084000''>OK,
  so what''s going to be our new notation?</span> <span m=''1087000''>Well, so it''s
  not particularly pleasant because it uses,</span> <span m=''1094000''>now, a subscript
  not to indicate what you are</span> <span m=''1096000''>differentiating, but rather
  what you were</span> <span m=''1098000''>holding constant. So, that''s quite a conflict
  of</span> <span m=''1102000''>notation with what we had before.</span> <span m=''1105000''>I
  think I can safely blame it on physicists or chemists.</span> <span m=''1112000''>OK,
  so this one means we keep y constant, and partial f over</span> <span m=''1123000''>partial
  u with v held constant, similarly.</span> <span m=''1131000''>OK, so now what happens
  is we no longer have any</span> <span m=''1134000''>contradiction. We have partial
  f over partial</span> <span m=''1139000''>x with y constant is different from partial
  f over partial x</span> <span m=''1146000''>with v constant, which is the same as
  partial f</span> <span m=''1152000''>over partial u with v constant. OK, so this
  guy is one.</span> <span m=''1158000''>And these guys are two. So, now we can safely
  use the</span> <span m=''1168000''>fact that x equals u if we are keeping track
  of what is</span> <span m=''1173000''>actually held constant, OK?</span> <span m=''1176000''>So
  now, that''s going to be particularly important when we</span> <span m=''1179000''>have
  variables that are related because,</span> <span m=''1181000''>let''s say now that
  I have a function that depends on x,</span> <span m=''1185000''>y, and z. But, x,
  y, and z are related.</span> <span m=''1188000''>Then, it means that I look at,
  say, x and y as my independent</span> <span m=''1194000''>variables, and z as a
  function of x and y.</span> <span m=''1199000''>Then, it means that when I do partials,
  say,</span> <span m=''1201000''>with respect to x, I will hold y constant.</span>
  <span m=''1204000''>But, I will let z vary as a function of x and y.</span> <span
  m=''1208000''>Or, I could do it the other way around.</span> <span m=''1210000''>I
  could vary x, keep z constant,</span> <span m=''1212000''>and let y be a function
  of x and z.</span> <span m=''1215000''>And so, I will need to use this kind of notation
  to indicate</span> <span m=''1224000''>which one I mean. OK, any questions?</span>
  <span m=''1234000''>No? All right, so let''s try to do</span> <span m=''1239000''>an
  example where we have a function that depends on</span> <span m=''1242000''>variables
  that are related. OK, so I don''t want to do one</span> <span m=''1246000''>with
  PV=nRT because probably, I mean, if you''ve seen it,</span> <span m=''1250000''>then
  you''ve seen too much of it.</span> <span m=''1253000''>And, if you haven''t seen
  it, then maybe it''s not the best</span> <span m=''1258000''>example. So, let''s
  do a geometric</span> <span m=''1262000''>example. So, let''s look at the area of</span>
  <span m=''1268000''>the triangle. So, let''s say I have a</span> <span m=''1274000''>triangle,
  and my variables will be the sides a and b.</span> <span m=''1281000''>And the angle
  here, theta. OK, so what''s the area of this</span> <span m=''1286000''>triangle?
  Well, its base times height</span> <span m=''1289000''>over two. So, it''s one half
  of the base</span> <span m=''1294000''>is a, and the height is b sine theta.</span>
  <span m=''1299000''>OK, so that''s a function of a, b, and theta.</span> <span m=''1305000''>Now,
  let''s say, actually, there is a relation</span> <span m=''1307000''>between a,
  b, and theta that I didn''t tell</span> <span m=''1309000''>you about, namely, actually,</span>
  <span m=''1312000''>I want to assume that it''s a right triangle,</span> <span m=''1318000''>OK?
  So, let''s now assume it''s a</span> <span m=''1325000''>right triangle with, let''s
  say, the hypotenuse is b.</span> <span m=''1336000''>So, we have the right angle
  here, actually.</span> <span m=''1339000''>So, a is here. b is here. Theta is here.</span>
  <span m=''1343000''>So, saying it''s a right triangle is the same thing as</span>
  <span m=''1348000''>saying that b equals sine theta, OK?</span> <span m=''1351000''>So
  that''s our constraint. That''s the relation between a,</span> <span m=''1357000''>b,
  and theta. And, this is a function of a,</span> <span m=''1366000''>b, and theta.
  And, let''s say that we want to</span> <span m=''1373000''>understand how the area
  depends on theta.</span> <span m=''1377000''>OK, what''s the rate of change of the
  area of this triangle</span> <span m=''1380000''>with respect to theta? So, I claim
  there''s various</span> <span m=''1386000''>answers. I can think of at least three</span>
  <span m=''1389000''>possible answers.</span> <span m=''1424000''>So, what can we
  possibly mean by the rate of change of A with</span> <span m=''1432000''>respect
  to theta? So, these are all things that</span> <span m=''1437000''>we might want
  to call partial A partial theta.</span> <span m=''1439000''>But of course, we''ll
  have to actually use</span> <span m=''1443000''>different notations to distinguish
  them.</span> <span m=''1446000''>So, the first way that we actually already know
  about is</span> <span m=''1451000''>if we just forget about the fact that the variables
  are related,</span> <span m=''1457000''>OK? So, if we just think of little</span>
  <span m=''1460000''>a, b, and theta as independent</span> <span m=''1463000''>variables,
  and we just change theta,</span> <span m=''1465000''>keeping a and b constant --
  So, that''s exactly what we meant by</span> <span m=''1488000''>partial A, partial
  theta, right?</span> <span m=''1491000''>I''m not putting any constraints. So, just
  to use some new</span> <span m=''1499000''>notation, that would be the rate of change
  of A with respect to</span> <span m=''1503000''>theta, keeping a and b fixed at
  the same time.</span> <span m=''1507000''>Of course, if we are keeping a and b fixed,
  and we are changing</span> <span m=''1511000''>theta, it means we completely ignore
  this property of being a</span> <span m=''1514000''>right triangle. So, in fact,</span>
  <span m=''1516000''>it corresponds to changing the area by changing the angle,</span>
  <span m=''1520000''>keeping these lengths fixed. And, of course,</span> <span m=''1523000''>we
  lose the right angle. When we rotate this side here,</span> <span m=''1527000''>but
  the angle doesn''t stay at a right angle.</span> <span m=''1532000''>And that one,
  we know how to compute,</span> <span m=''1535000''>right, because it''s the one
  we''ve been computing all along.</span> <span m=''1540000''>So, that means we keep
  a and b fixed.</span> <span m=''1544000''>And then, so let''s see, what''s the derivatives
  of A</span> <span m=''1551000''>with respect to theta? It''s one half ab cosine
  theta.</span> <span m=''1562000''>OK, now that one we know. Any questions?</span>
  <span m=''1571000''>No? OK, the two other guys will be</span> <span m=''1574000''>more
  interesting. So far, I''m not really doing</span> <span m=''1578000''>anything with
  my constraint. Let''s say that actually I do</span> <span m=''1583000''>want to
  keep the right angle. Then, when I change theta,</span> <span m=''1587000''>there''s
  two options. One is I keep a constant,</span> <span m=''1591000''>and then of course
  b will have to change because if this width</span> <span m=''1595000''>stays the
  same, then when I change theta,</span> <span m=''1598000''>the height increases,
  and then this side length</span> <span m=''1601000''>increases. The other option
  is to change</span> <span m=''1605000''>the angle, keeping b constant. So, actually,</span>
  <span m=''1607000''>this side stays the same length.</span> <span m=''1609000''>But
  then, a has to become a bit shorter.</span> <span m=''1613000''>And, of course,
  the area will change in</span> <span m=''1616000''>different ways depending on what
  I do.</span> <span m=''1619000''>So, that''s why I said we have three different
  answers.</span> <span m=''1625000''>So, the next one is keep, I forgot which one
  I said</span> <span m=''1630000''>first. Let''s say keep a constant.</span> <span
  m=''1637000''>And, that means that b will change.</span> <span m=''1646000''>b is
  going to be some function of a and theta.</span> <span m=''1650000''>Well, in fact
  here, we know what the function is</span> <span m=''1654000''>because we can solve
  the constraint, namely,</span> <span m=''1657000''>b is a over cosine theta. But
  we don''t actually need to</span> <span m=''1665000''>know that so that the triangle,
  so that the right angle,</span> <span m=''1675000''>so that we keep a right angle.
  And, so the name we will have</span> <span m=''1685000''>for this is partial a over
  partial theta with a held</span> <span m=''1691000''>constant, OK? And, the fact
  that I''m not</span> <span m=''1694000''>putting b in my subscript there means that
  actually b will be a</span> <span m=''1697000''>dependent variable. It changes in
  whatever way it</span> <span m=''1700000''>has to change so that when theta changes,
  a stays the same while</span> <span m=''1706000''>b changes so that we keep a right
  triangle.</span> <span m=''1718000''>And, the third guy is the one where we actually
  keep b</span> <span m=''1726000''>constant, and now a,</span> <span m=''1731000''>we
  think a as a function of b and theta,</span> <span m=''1734000''>and it changes
  so that we keep the right angle.</span> <span m=''1738000''>So actually as a function
  of b and theta, it''s given over</span> <span m=''1741000''>there. A equals b cosine
  theta.</span> <span m=''1746000''>And so, this guy is called partial a over partial
  theta</span> <span m=''1753000''>with b held constant. OK, so we''ve just defined
  them.</span> <span m=''1759000''>We don''t know yet how to compute these things.</span>
  <span m=''1761000''>That''s what we''re going to do now.</span> <span m=''1762000''>That
  is the definition, and what these things mean.</span> <span m=''1765000''>Is that
  clear to everyone? Yes, OK.</span> <span m=''1773000''>Yes? OK, so the second answer,</span>
  <span m=''1781000''>again, so one way to ask ourselves,</span> <span m=''1786000''>how
  does the area depend on theta,</span> <span m=''1788000''>is to say, well, actually
  look at the area of</span> <span m=''1793000''>the right triangle as a function
  of a and theta only by solving</span> <span m=''1799000''>for b. And then, we''ll
  change theta,</span> <span m=''1803000''>keep a constant, and ask, how does the
  area</span> <span m=''1806000''>change? So, when we do that,</span> <span m=''1808000''>when
  we change theta and keep a the same,</span> <span m=''1811000''>then b has to change
  so that it stays a right triangle,</span> <span m=''1814000''>right, so that this
  relation still holds.</span> <span m=''1818000''>That requires us to change b. So,
  when we write partial a</span> <span m=''1822000''>over partial theta with a constant,
  it means that,</span> <span m=''1826000''>actually, b will be the dependent variable.</span>
  <span m=''1830000''>It depends on a and theta. And so, the area depends on</span>
  <span m=''1835000''>theta, not only because theta is in the formula,</span> <span
  m=''1840000''>but also because b changes, and b is in the formula.</span> <span
  m=''1846000''>Yes? No, no, we don''t keep theta</span> <span m=''1853000''>constant.
  We vary theta, right?</span> <span m=''1854000''>The goal is to see how things change
  when I change theta by a</span> <span m=''1858000''>little bit. OK, so if I change
  theta a</span> <span m=''1861000''>little bit in this one, if I change theta a little
  bit</span> <span m=''1864000''>and I keep a the same, then b has to change also
  in</span> <span m=''1867000''>some way. There''s a right triangle.</span> <span
  m=''1869000''>And then, because theta and b change, that causes the area to</span>
  <span m=''1876000''>change. OK, so maybe I should</span> <span m=''1878000''>re-explain
  that again. So, theta changes.</span> <span m=''1883000''>A is constant. But, we
  have the constraint,</span> <span m=''1890000''>a equals be plus sine theta. That
  means that b changes.</span> <span m=''1897000''>And then, the question is, how
  does A change?</span> <span m=''1903000''>Well, it will change in part because theta
  changes,</span> <span m=''1906000''>and in part because b changes. But, we want
  to know how it</span> <span m=''1910000''>depends on theta in this situation.</span>
  <span m=''1914000''>Yes? Ah, that''s a very good question.</span> <span m=''1924000''>So,
  what about, I don''t keep a and b constant?</span> <span m=''1928000''>Well, then
  there''s too many choices.</span> <span m=''1930000''>So I have to decide actually
  how I''m going to change things.</span> <span m=''1933000''>See, if I just say I
  have this relation, that means I have two</span> <span m=''1937000''>independent
  variables left, whichever two of the three I</span> <span m=''1940000''>want. But,
  I still have to specify</span> <span m=''1943000''>two of them to say exactly which
  triangle I mean.</span> <span m=''1947000''>So, I cannot ask myself just how will
  it change if I change</span> <span m=''1951000''>theta and do random things with
  a and b?</span> <span m=''1954000''>It depends what I do with a and b.</span> <span
  m=''1956000''>Of course, I could choose to change them simultaneously,</span> <span
  m=''1960000''>but then I have to specify how exactly I''m going to do that.</span>
  <span m=''1965000''>Ah, yes, if you wanted to, indeed, we could also change</span>
  <span m=''1969000''>things in such a way that the third side remains constant.</span>
  <span m=''1973000''>And that would be, yet, a different way to attack</span> <span
  m=''1975000''>the problem. I mean, we don''t have good</span> <span m=''1977000''>notation
  for this, here, because we didn''t give it</span> <span m=''1980000''>a name. But,
  yeah, I mean, we could.</span> <span m=''1981000''>We could call this guy c, and
  then we''d have a different</span> <span m=''1987000''>formula, and so on. So, I
  mean, I''m not looking at</span> <span m=''1991000''>it for simplicity. But, you
  could have many more.</span> <span m=''1997000''>I mean, in general, you will want,</span>
  <span m=''1999000''>once you have a set of nice, natural variables,</span> <span
  m=''2002000''>you will want to look mostly at situations where one of the</span>
  <span m=''2005000''>variables changes. Some of them are held fixed,</span> <span
  m=''2009000''>and then some dependent variable does whatever it must</span> <span
  m=''2013000''>so that the constraint keeps holding.</span> <span m=''2016000''>OK,
  so let''s try to compute one of them.</span> <span m=''2019000''>Let''s say I decide
  that we will compute this one.</span> <span m=''2024000''>OK, let''s see how we
  can compute partial a,</span> <span m=''2026000''>partial theta with a held fixed.</span>
  <span m=''2061000''>[APPLAUSE] OK, so let''s try to compute</span> <span m=''2067000''>partial
  A, partial theta with a held constant.</span> <span m=''2074000''>So, let''s see
  three different ways of doing that.</span> <span m=''2080000''>So, let me start
  with method zero.</span> <span m=''2085000''>OK, it''s not a real method. That''s
  why I''m not getting a</span> <span m=''2090000''>positive number. So, that one
  is just,</span> <span m=''2094000''>we solve for b, and we remove b from the</span>
  <span m=''2098000''>formulas. OK, so here it works well</span> <span m=''2101000''>because
  we know how to solve for b.</span> <span m=''2104000''>But I''m not considering
  this to be a real method because in</span> <span m=''2107000''>general we don''t
  know how to do that.</span> <span m=''2108000''>I mean, in the beginning I had this
  relation that was an</span> <span m=''2112000''>equation of degree three. You don''t
  really want to solve</span> <span m=''2116000''>your equation for the dependent
  variable usually.</span> <span m=''2119000''>Here, we can. So, solve for b and substitute.</span>
  <span m=''2133000''>So, how do we do that? Well, the constraint is a=b</span> <span
  m=''2138000''>cosine theta. That means b is a over cosine</span> <span m=''2145000''>theta.
  Some of you know that as a</span> <span m=''2148000''>secan theta. That''s the same.</span>
  <span m=''2156000''>And now, if we express the area in terms of a and theta only,</span>
  <span m=''2164000''>A is one half of ab cosine, sorry, ab sine theta is now one</span>
  <span m=''2173000''>half of a^2 sine theta over cosine theta.</span> <span m=''2180000''>Or,
  if you prefer, one half of a^2 tangent theta.</span> <span m=''2189000''>Well, now
  that it''s only a function of a and theta,</span> <span m=''2192000''>I know what
  it means to take the partial derivative with</span> <span m=''2195000''>respect
  to theta, keeping a constant.</span> <span m=''2198000''>I know how to do it. So,
  partial A over partial</span> <span m=''2211000''>theta, a held constant,</span>
  <span m=''2215000''>well, if a is a constant, then I get this one half a^2</span>
  <span m=''2219000''>coming out times, what''s the derivative of</span> <span m=''2223000''>tangent?
  Secan squared, very good.</span> <span m=''2229000''>If you''re European and you''ve
  never heard of secan,</span> <span m=''2232000''>that''s one over cosine. And, if
  you know the derivative</span> <span m=''2235000''>as one plus tangent squared,
  that''s the same thing.</span> <span m=''2238000''>And, it''s also correct. OK,
  so, that''s one way of doing</span> <span m=''2244000''>it. But, as I''ve already
  said,</span> <span m=''2246000''>it doesn''t get us very far if we don''t know how
  to solve for</span> <span m=''2250000''>b. We really used the fact that we</span>
  <span m=''2253000''>could solve for b and get rid of it.</span> <span m=''2256000''>So,
  there''s two systematic methods, and let''s say the basic</span> <span m=''2265000''>rule
  is that you should give both of them a chance.</span> <span m=''2273000''>You should
  see which one you prefer, and you should be able</span> <span m=''2276000''>to use
  one or the other on the exam.</span> <span m=''2279000''>OK, most likely you''ll
  actually have a choice between one or the</span> <span m=''2284000''>other. It will
  be up to you to decide</span> <span m=''2286000''>which one you want to use. But,
  you cannot use solving in</span> <span m=''2290000''>substitution. That''s not fair.</span>
  <span m=''2294000''>OK, so the first one is to use differentials.</span> <span m=''2305000''>By
  the way, in the notes they are called also method one and</span> <span m=''2309000''>method
  two. I''m not promising that I have</span> <span m=''2312000''>the same one, am
  I? I mean, I might have one and two switched.</span> <span m=''2315000''>It doesn''t
  really matter. So, how do we do things using</span> <span m=''2319000''>differentials?
  Well, first,</span> <span m=''2323000''>we know that we want to keep a fixed, and
  that means that we''ll</span> <span m=''2332000''>set da equal to zero, OK?</span>
  <span m=''2336000''>The second thing that we want to do is we want to look at the</span>
  <span m=''2340000''>constraint. The constraint is a equals b</span> <span m=''2344000''>cosine
  theta. And, we want to differentiate</span> <span m=''2348000''>that. Well, differentiate
  the</span> <span m=''2350000''>left-hand side. You get da.</span> <span m=''2355000''>And,
  differentiate the right-hand side as a function of</span> <span m=''2358000''>b
  and theta. You should get,</span> <span m=''2360000''>well, how many db''s? Well,
  that''s the rate of change</span> <span m=''2363000''>with respect to b. That''s
  cosine theta db minus b</span> <span m=''2368000''>sine theta d theta. That''s a
  product rule applied</span> <span m=''2375000''>to b times cosine theta. So -- Well,
  now,</span> <span m=''2387000''>if we have a constraint that''s relating da, db,</span>
  <span m=''2391000''>and d theta, OK, so that''s actually what we</span> <span m=''2394000''>did,
  right, that''s the same sort of thing</span> <span m=''2396000''>as what we did
  at the beginning when we related dx,</span> <span m=''2399000''>dy, and dz. That''s
  really the same thing,</span> <span m=''2402000''>except now are variables are a,
  b, and theta.</span> <span m=''2405000''>Now, we know that also we are keeping a
  fixed.</span> <span m=''2407000''>So actually, we set this equal to zero.</span>
  <span m=''2410000''>So, we have zero equals da equals cosine theta db minus b</span>
  <span m=''2418000''>sine theta d theta. That means that actually we</span> <span
  m=''2423000''>know how to solve for db. OK, so cosine theta db equals b</span> <span
  m=''2433000''>sine theta d theta or db is b tangent theta d theta.</span> <span
  m=''2445000''>OK, so in fact, what we found,</span> <span m=''2447000''>if you want,
  is the rate of change of b with</span> <span m=''2450000''>respect to theta. Why
  do we care?</span> <span m=''2453000''>Well, we care because let''s look, now, at
  dA,</span> <span m=''2459000''>the function that we want to look at.</span> <span
  m=''2463000''>OK, so the function is A equals one half ab sine theta.</span> <span
  m=''2472000''>Well, then, dA, so we had to use the product</span> <span m=''2475000''>rule
  carefully, or we use the partials.</span> <span m=''2478000''>So, the coefficient
  of d little a will be partial with respect</span> <span m=''2481000''>to little
  a. That''s one half b sine theta da</span> <span m=''2486000''>plus coefficient
  of db will be one half a sine theta db plus</span> <span m=''2496000''>coefficient
  of d theta will be one half ab cosine theta d</span> <span m=''2505000''>theta.
  But now, what do I do with that?</span> <span m=''2508000''>Well, first I said a
  is constant.</span> <span m=''2512000''>So, da is zero. Second, well,</span> <span
  m=''2516000''>actually we don''t like b at all, right?</span> <span m=''2519000''>We
  want to view a as a function of theta.</span> <span m=''2523000''>So, well, maybe
  we actually want to use this formula for db</span> <span m=''2533000''>that we found
  in here. OK, and then we''ll be left only</span> <span m=''2538000''>with d thetas,
  which is what we want.</span> <span m=''2576000''>So, if we plug this one into that
  one, we get da equals one</span> <span m=''2586000''>half a sine theta times b tangent
  theta d theta plus one</span> <span m=''2596000''>half ab cosine theta d theta.
  And, if we collect these things</span> <span m=''2606000''>together, we get one
  half of ab times sine theta times tangent</span> <span m=''2615000''>theta plus
  cosine theta d theta. And, if you know your trig,</span> <span m=''2621000''>but
  you''ll see that this is sine squared over cosine plus</span> <span m=''2624000''>cosine
  squared over cosine. That''s the same as secan theta.</span> <span m=''2629000''>So,
  now you have expressed da as something times d theta.</span> <span m=''2634000''>Well,
  that coefficient is the rate of change of A with respect</span> <span m=''2639000''>to
  theta with the understanding that we are keeping a fixed,</span> <span m=''2644000''>and
  letting b vary as a dependent variable.</span> <span m=''2650000''>Not enough space:
  sorry.</span> <span m=''2666000''>OK, in case it''s clearer for you, let''s think
  about it</span> <span m=''2669000''>backwards. So, we wanted to find how A</span>
  <span m=''2672000''>changes. To find how A changes,</span> <span m=''2675000''>we
  write da. But now, this tells us how A</span> <span m=''2678000''>depends on little
  a, little b, and theta.</span> <span m=''2681000''>Well, we know actually we want
  to keep little a constant.</span> <span m=''2685000''>So, we set this to be zero.
  Theta, well,</span> <span m=''2689000''>we are very happy because we want to express
  things in terms</span> <span m=''2692000''>of theta. Db we want to get rid of.</span>
  <span m=''2695000''>How do we get rid of db? Well, we do that by figuring</span>
  <span m=''2700000''>out how b depends on theta when a is fixed.</span> <span m=''2705000''>And,
  we do that by differentiating the constraint</span> <span m=''2708000''>equation,
  and setting da equal to zero.</span> <span m=''2712000''>OK, so -- I guess to summarize
  the method, we wrote dA in terms</span> <span m=''2731000''>of da, db, d theta.
  Then, we say that a is constant</span> <span m=''2741000''>means we set da equals
  zero. And, the third thing is that</span> <span m=''2750000''>because, well, we
  differentiate the</span> <span m=''2757000''>constraint. And, we can solve for db
  in</span> <span m=''2766000''>terms of d theta. And then, we plug into dA,</span>
  <span m=''2779000''>and we get the answer. OK, oops.</span> <span m=''2792000''>So,
  here''s another method to do the same thing differently is to</span> <span m=''2798000''>use
  the chain rule. So, we can use the chain rule</span> <span m=''2803000''>with dependent
  variables, OK?</span> <span m=''2805000''>So, what does the chain rule tell us?</span>
  <span m=''2808000''>The chain rule tells us, so we will want to</span> <span m=''2814000''>differentiate
  -- -- the formula for a with respect to theta</span> <span m=''2822000''>holding
  a constant. So, I claim,</span> <span m=''2826000''>well, what does the chain rule
  tell us?</span> <span m=''2830000''>It tells us that, well, when we change things,</span>
  <span m=''2834000''>a changes because of the changes in the variables.</span> <span
  m=''2839000''>So, part of it is that A depends on theta and theta</span> <span m=''2844000''>changes.
  How fast does theta change?</span> <span m=''2848000''>Well, you could call that
  the rate of change of theta with</span> <span m=''2851000''>respect to theta with
  a constant.</span> <span m=''2853000''>But of course, how fast does theta depend
  to</span> <span m=''2855000''>itself? The answer is one.</span> <span m=''2858000''>So,
  that''s pretty easy. Plus, then we have the partial</span> <span m=''2864000''>derivative,
  formal partial derivative, of A with respect to</span> <span m=''2869000''>little
  a times the rate of change of a in our situation.</span> <span m=''2875000''>Well,
  how does little a change if a is constant?</span> <span m=''2878000''>Well, it doesn''t
  change. And then, there is Ab,</span> <span m=''2888000''>the formal partial derivative
  times, sorry,</span> <span m=''2894000''>the rate of change of b. OK, and how do
  we find this one?</span> <span m=''2900000''>Well, here we have to use the constraint.</span>
  <span m=''2907000''>OK, and we can find this one from the constraint as we''ve</span>
  <span m=''2910000''>seen at the beginning either by differentiating the constraint,</span>
  <span m=''2912000''>or by using the chain rule on the constraint.</span> <span m=''2916000''>So,
  of course the calculations are exactly the same.</span> <span m=''2919000''>See,
  this is the same formula as the one over there,</span> <span m=''2924000''>just
  dividing everything by partial theta and with</span> <span m=''2928000''>subscripts
  little a. But, if it''s easier to think</span> <span m=''2934000''>about it this
  way, then that''s also valid.</span> <span m=''2939000''>OK, so tomorrow we are
  going to review for the test,</span> <span m=''2943000''>so I''m going to tell you
  a bit more about this also as we go</span> <span m=''2946000''>over one practice
  problem on that.</span> </p>'
