  </p><p><span m='25000'>Recall that yesterday we saw, no, two days ago we learned</span>
  <span m='32000'>about the curl of a vector field in space.</span> </p><p><span m='37000'>And
  we said the curl of F is defined by taking a cross</span> <span m='45000'>product
  between the symbol dell and the vector F.</span> </p><p><span m='52000'>Concretely,
  the way we would compute this would be by putting</span> <span m='58000'>the components
  of F into this determinant and expanding and</span> <span m='64000'>then getting
  a vector with components Ry minus Qz,</span> <span m='69000'>Pz minus Rx and Qx
  minus Py. I think I also tried to explain</span> <span m='81000'>very quickly what
  the significance of a curl is.</span> </p><p><span m='85000'>Just to tell you again
  very quickly,</span> <span m='88000'>basically curl measures, if you mention that
  your vector</span> <span m='94000'>field measures the velocity in some fluid then
  the curl</span> <span m='100000'>measures how much rotation is taking place in that
  fluid.</span> </p><p><span m='107000'>Measures the rotation part of a velocity field.</span>
  </p><p><span m='125000'>More precisely the direction corresponds to the axis of</span>
  <span m='133000'>rotation and the magnitude corresponds to twice the angular</span>
  <span m='142000'>velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='167000'>Just to give you a few
  quick examples.</span> </p><p><span m='170000'>If I take a constant vector field,</span>
  <span m='173000'>so everything translates at the same speed,</span> <span m='181000'>then
  obviously when you take the partial derivatives you will</span> <span m='186000'>just
  get a bunch of zeros so the curl will be zero.</span> </p><p><span m='190000'>If
  you take a vector field that stretches things,</span> <span m='195000'>let's say,
  for example, we are going to stretch things</span> <span m='197000'>along the x-axis,
  that would be a vector field</span> <span m='203000'>that goes parallel to the x
  direction but maybe,</span> <span m='210000'>say, x times i. So that when you are
  in front</span> <span m='213000'>of a plane of a blackboard you are moving forward,</span>
  <span m='215000'>when you are behind you are moving backwards,</span> <span m='216000'>things
  are getting expanded in the x direction.</span> </p><p><span m='220000'>If you compute
  the curl, you can check each of these.</span> </p><p><span m='228000'>Again, they
  are going to be zero.</span> </p><p><span m='229000'>There is no curl. This is not
  what curl measures.</span> </p><p><span m='233000'>I mean, actually, what measures
  expansion,</span> <span m='238000'>stretching is actually divergence.</span> </p><p><span
  m='243000'>If you take the divergence of this field,</span> <span m='245000'>you
  would get one plus zero plus zero,</span> <span m='247000'>it looks like it will
  be one, so in case you don't remember,</span> <span m='250000'>I mean divergence
  precisely measures this stretching effect</span> <span m='255000'>in your field.
  And, on the other hand,</span> <span m='258000'>if you take something that corresponds
  to,</span> <span m='262000'>say, rotation about the z-axis at</span> <span m='266000'>unit
  angular velocity -- That means they are going to moving</span> <span m='274000'>in
  circles around the z-axis. One way to write down this</span> <span m='281000'>field,
  let's see, the z component is zero because</span> <span m='286000'>everything is
  moving horizontally.</span> </p><p><span m='290000'>And in the x and y directions,
  if you look at it from above,</span> <span m='294000'>well, it is just going to
  be our good old friend the vector</span> <span m='299000'>field that rotates everything
  [at unit speed?].</span> </p><p><span m='302000'>And we have seen the formula for
  this one many times.</span> </p><p><span m='305000'>The first component is minus
  y, the second one is x.</span> </p><p><span m='309000'>Now, if you compute the curl
  of this guy, you will get zero,</span> <span m='317000'>zero, two, two k. And so
  k is the axis of</span> <span m='321000'>rotation, two is twice the angular velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='324000'>And now, of course, you can imagine much more</span> <span
  m='326000'>complicated motions where you will have -- For example,</span> <span
  m='329000'>if you look at the Charles River very carefully then you</span> <span
  m='332000'>will see that water is flowing, generally speaking,</span> <span m='334000'>towards
  the ocean. But, at the same time,</span> <span m='338000'>there are actually a few
  eddies in there and with water</span> <span m='343000'>swirling. Those are the places
  where</span> <span m='347000'>there is actually curl in the flow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='351000'>Yes. I don't know how to turn out</span> <span m='356000'>the lights
  a bit, but I'm sure there is a way.</span> </p><p><span m='360000'>Does this do
  it? Is it working?</span> </p><p><span m='370000'>OK. You're welcome.</span> </p><p><span
  m='383000'>Hopefully it is easier to see now.</span> </p><p><span m='391000'>That
  was about curl. Now, why do we care about curl</span> <span m='395000'>besides this
  motivation of understanding motions?</span> </p><p><span m='400000'>One place where
  it comes up is when we try to understand</span> <span m='403000'>whether a vector
  field is conservative.</span> </p><p><span m='405000'>Remember we have seen that
  a vector field is conservative if</span> <span m='409000'>and only if its curl is
  zero. That is the situation in which</span> <span m='413000'>we are allowed to try
  to look for a potential function and</span> <span m='416000'>then use the fundamental
  theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='417000'>But another place where this comes up,</span>
  <span m='420000'>if you remember what we did in the plane,</span> <span m='422000'>curl
  also came up when we tried to convert nine integrals into</span> <span m='426000'>double
  integrals. That was Greene's theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='430000'>Well, it turns
  out we can do the same thing in space and that</span> <span m='439000'>is called
  Stokes' theorem. What does Stokes' theorem say?</span> </p><p><span m='448000'>It
  says that the work done by a vector field along a closed</span> <span m='456000'>curve
  can be replaced by a double integral of curl F.</span> </p><p><span m='464000'>Let
  me write it using the dell notation.</span> </p><p><span m='467000'>That is curl
  F. Dot ndS on a suitably chosen</span> <span m='474000'>surface. That is a very
  strange kind of</span> <span m='478000'>statement. But actually it is not much</span>
  <span m='481000'>more strange than things we have seen before.</span> </p><p><span
  m='484000'>I should clarify what this means.</span> </p><p><span m='489000'>C has
  to be a closed curve in space.</span> </p><p><span m='497000'>And S can be any surface
  bounded by C.</span> </p><p><span m='512000'>For example, what Stokes' theorem tells
  me</span> <span m='516000'>is that let us say that I have to compute some line integral
  on</span> <span m='521000'>maybe, say, the unit circle in the x,</span> <span m='528000'>y
  plane. Of course I can set a line</span> <span m='532000'>integral directly and
  compute it by setting x equals cosine T,</span> <span m='537000'>y equals sine T,
  z equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m='540000'>But maybe sometimes I don't want to
  do that because my</span> <span m='543000'>vector field is really complicated.</span>
  </p><p><span m='546000'>And instead I will want to reduce things to a surface</span>
  <span m='551000'>integral. Now, I know that you guys are</span> <span m='553000'>not
  necessarily fond of computing flux of vector fields</span> <span m='556000'>for
  surfaces so maybe you don't really see the point.</span> </p><p><span m='559000'>But
  sometimes it is useful. Sometimes it is also useful</span> <span m='562000'>backwards
  because, actually, you have a surface</span> <span m='565000'>integral that you
  would like to turn into a line integral.</span> </p><p><span m='569000'>What Stokes'
  theorem says is that I can choose my favorite</span> <span m='574000'>surface whose
  boundary is this circle.</span> </p><p><span m='578000'>I could choose, for example,</span>
  <span m='582000'>a half sphere if I want or I can choose, let's call that s1,</span>
  <span m='590000'>I don't know, a pointy thing,</span> <span m='594000'>s2. Probably
  the most logical one,</span> <span m='597000'>actually, would be just to choose
  a disk in the x,</span> <span m='600000'>y plane. That would probably be the</span>
  <span m='602000'>easiest one to set up for calculating flux.</span> </p><p><span
  m='604000'>Anyway, what Stokes' theorem tells me</span> <span m='607000'>is I can
  choose any of these surfaces,</span> <span m='609000'>whichever one I want, and
  I can compute the flux of</span> <span m='614000'>curl F through this surface. Curl
  F is a new vector field</span> <span m='618000'>when you have this formula that
  gives you a vector field you</span> <span m='622000'>compute its flux through your
  favorite surface,</span> <span m='625000'>and you should get the same thing as if
  you had done the</span> <span m='631000'>line integral for F. That is the statement.</span>
  </p><p><span m='637000'>Now, there is a catch here. What is the catch?</span> </p><p><span
  m='643000'>Well, the catch is we have to figure out what conventions to</span> <span
  m='647000'>use because remember when we have a surface there are two</span> <span
  m='651000'>possible orientations. We have to decide which way we</span> <span m='654000'>will
  counter flux positively, which way we will counter flux</span> <span m='658000'>negatively.
  And, if we change our choice,</span> <span m='661000'>then of course the flux will
  become the opposite.</span> </p><p><span m='665000'>Well, similarly to define the
  work, I need to choose which way</span> <span m='668000'>I am going to run my curve.
  If I change which way I go</span> <span m='672000'>around the curve then my work
  will become the opposite.</span> </p><p><span m='676000'>What happens is I have
  to orient the curve C and the</span> <span m='681000'>surface S in compatible ways.
  We have to figure out what the</span> <span m='688000'>rule is for how the orientation
  of S and that of C relate to</span> <span m='696000'>each other. What about orientation?</span>
  </p><p><span m='701000'>Well, we need the orientations of C and S to be compatible
  and</span> <span m='715000'>they have to explain to you what the rule is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='725000'>Let me show you a picture. The rule is if I walk along C</span>
  <span m='735000'>with S to my left then the normal vector is pointing up for</span>
  <span m='743000'>me. Let me write that.</span> </p><p><span m='749000'>If I walk
  along C, I should say in the positive</span> <span m='757000'>direction, in the
  direction that I have chosen to orient C.</span> </p><p><span m='768000'>With S
  to my left then n is pointing up for me.</span> </p><p><span m='786000'>Here is
  the example. If I am walking on this curve,</span> <span m='790000'>it looks like
  the surface is to my left.</span> </p><p><span m='792000'>And so the normal vector
  is going towards what is up for me.</span> </p><p><span m='799000'>Any questions
  about that? I see some people using their</span> <span m='806000'>right hands. That
  is also right-handable</span> <span m='808000'>which I am going to say in just a
  few moments.</span> </p><p><span m='811000'>That is another way to remember this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='812000'>Before I tell you about the right-handable version,</span>
  <span m='818000'>let me just try something. Actually, I am not happy with</span>
  <span m='823000'>this orientation of C and I want to orient my curve C going</span>
  <span m='827000'>clockwise on the picture. So the other orientation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='831000'>Then, if I walk on it this way, the surface would be to my</span> <span
  m='835000'>right. You can remember,</span> <span m='836000'>if it helps you, that
  if a surface is to your</span> <span m='839000'>right then the normal vector will
  go down.</span> </p><p><span m='841000'>The other way to think about this rule is
  enough because if</span> <span m='844000'>you are walking clockwise, well, you can
  change that to</span> <span m='847000'>counterclockwise just by walking upside down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='850000'>This guy is walking clockwise on C.</span> </p><p><span
  m='854000'>And while for him, if you look carefully at the</span> <span m='861000'>picture,
  the surface is actually to his left when you flip upside</span> <span m='871000'>down.
  Yeah, it is kind of confusing.</span> </p><p><span m='874000'>But, anyway, maybe
  it's easier if you</span> <span m='878000'>actually rotate in the picture. And now
  it is getting actually</span> <span m='884000'>really confusing because his walking
  upside up with,</span> <span m='890000'>actually, the surface is to his left.</span>
  </p><p><span m='894000'>I mean where he is at here is actually at the front and
  this</span> <span m='898000'>is the back, but that is kind of hard to see.</span>
  </p><p><span m='901000'>Anyway, whichever method will work best for you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='905000'>Perhaps it is easiest to first do it with the other</span>
  <span m='907000'>orientation, this one,</span> <span m='909000'>and this side, if
  you want the opposite one,</span> <span m='913000'>then you will just flip everything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='921000'>Now, what is the other way of remembering this with the</span>
  <span m='925000'>right-hand rule? First of all,</span> <span m='927000'>take your
  right hand, not your left.</span> </p><p><span m='929000'>Even if your right hand
  is actually using a pen or</span> <span m='932000'>something like that in your right
  hand do this.</span> </p><p><span m='934000'>And let's take your fingers in order.</span>
  </p><p><span m='937000'>First your thumb. Let's make your thumb go along</span>
  <span m='940000'>the object that has only one dimension in there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='942000'>That is the curve. Well, let's look at the top</span> <span m='947000'>picture
  up there. I want my thumb to go along the</span> <span m='952000'>curve so that
  is kind of towards the right.</span> </p><p><span m='956000'>Then I want to make
  my index finger point towards the</span> <span m='966000'>surface. Towards the surface
  I mean</span> <span m='969000'>towards the interior of the surface from the curve.</span>
  </p><p><span m='972000'>And when I am on the curve I am on the boundary of the surface,</span>
  <span m='975000'>so there is a direction along the surface that is the curve</span>
  <span m='978000'>and the other one is pointing into the surface.</span> </p><p><span
  m='980000'>That one would be pointing kind of to the back slightly up</span> <span
  m='984000'>maybe, so like that. And now your middle finger is</span> <span m='987000'>going
  to point in the direction of the normal vector.</span> </p><p><span m='990000'>That
  is up, at least if you have the same kind of right hand</span> <span m='997000'>as
  I do. The other way of doing it is</span> <span m='1009000'>using the right-hand
  rule along C positively.</span> </p><p><span m='1028000'>The index finger towards
  the interior of S.</span> </p><p><span m='1038000'>Sorry, I shouldn't say interior.
  I should say tangent to S</span> <span m='1047000'>towards the interior of S. What
  I mean by that is really</span> <span m='1054000'>the part of S that is not its
  boundary, so the rest of the</span> <span m='1059000'>surface. Then the middle finger
  points</span> <span m='1069000'>parallel to n. Let's practice.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1080000'>Let's say that I gave you this curve bounding this surface.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1089000'>Which way do you think the normal vector will be going?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1093000'>Up. Yes. Everyone is voting up. Imaging that I am walking</span> <span
  m='1096000'>around C. That is to my left.</span> </p><p><span m='1098000'>Normal
  vector points up. Imagine that you put your thumb</span> <span m='1104000'>along
  C, your index towards S and then your middle finger</span> <span m='1112000'>points
  up. Very good.</span> </p><p><span m='1116000'>N points up. Another one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1145000'>It is interesting to watch you guys.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1147000'>I think mostly it is going up. The correct answer is it goes</span>
  <span m='1153000'>up and into the cone. How do we see that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1160000'>Well, one way to think about it is imagine that you are walking</span>
  <span m='1164000'>on C, on the rim of this cone. You have two options.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1167000'>Imagine that you are walking kind of inside or imagine that</span> <span
  m='1170000'>you are walking kind of outside. If you are walking outside then</span>
  <span m='1173000'>S is to your right, but it does not sound good.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1175000'>Let's say instead that you are walking on the inside of a cone</span>
  <span m='1179000'>following the boundary. Well, then the surface is to</span> <span
  m='1183000'>your left. And so the normal vector will</span> <span m='1185000'>be
  up for you which means it will be pointing slightly up and</span> <span m='1190000'>into
  the cone. Another way to think about it,</span> <span m='1192000'>through the right-hand
  rule, from this way index going kind</span> <span m='1196000'>of down because the
  surface goes down and a bit to the back.</span> </p><p><span m='1200000'>And then
  the normal vector points up and in.</span> </p><p><span m='1204000'>Yet another
  way, if you deform continuously your</span> <span m='1208000'>surface then the conventions
  will not change.</span> </p><p><span m='1212000'>See, this is kind of [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</span>
  <span m='1215000'>in a way. You can deform things and</span> <span m='1217000'>nothing
  will change. So what if we somehow flatten</span> <span m='1221000'>our cone, push
  it a bit up so that it becomes completely flat?</span> </p><p><span m='1227000'>Then,
  if you had a flat disk with the curve going</span> <span m='1230000'>counterclockwise,
  the normal vector would go up.</span> </p><p><span m='1233000'>Now take your disk
  with its normal vector sticking up.</span> </p><p><span m='1236000'>If you want
  to paint the face a different color so that you can</span> <span m='1239000'>remember
  that was beside with a normal vector and then push it</span> <span m='1243000'>back
  down to the cone, you will see that the painted</span> <span m='1245000'>face, the
  one with the normal vector</span> <span m='1248000'>on that side is the one that
  is inside and up.</span> </p><p><span m='1252000'>Does that make sense? Anyway,
  I think you have just</span> <span m='1259000'>to play with these examples for long
  enough and get it.</span> </p><p><span m='1263000'>OK. The last one. Let's say that
  I have a</span> <span m='1267000'>cylinder. So now this guy has actually</span>
  <span m='1270000'>two boundary curves, C and C prime.</span> </p><p><span m='1272000'>And
  let's say I want to orient my cylinder so that the normal</span> <span m='1276000'>vector
  sticks out. How should I choose the</span> <span m='1280000'>orientation of my curves?
  Let's start with,</span> <span m='1290000'>say, the bottom one. Would the bottom
  one be going</span> <span m='1300000'>clockwise or counterclockwise. Most people
  seem to say</span> <span m='1304000'>counterclockwise, and I agree with that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1307000'>Let me write that down and claim C prime should go</span>
  <span m='1311000'>counterclockwise. One way to think about it,</span> <span m='1315000'>actually,
  it's quite easy, you mentioned that you're</span> <span m='1318000'>walking on the
  outside of the cylinder along C prime.</span> </p><p><span m='1322000'>If you want
  to walk along C prime so that the cylinder is to</span> <span m='1326000'>your left,
  that means you have to actually go counterclockwise</span> <span m='1330000'>around
  it. The other way is use your right</span> <span m='1334000'>hand. Say when you're
  at the front of</span> <span m='1337000'>C prime, your thumb points to the right,</span>
  <span m='1339000'>your index points up because that's where the surface is,</span>
  <span m='1343000'>and then your middle finger will point out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1348000'>What about C? Well, C I claim we should be</span> <span m='1359000'>doing
  clockwise. I mean think about just walking</span> <span m='1363000'>again on the
  surface of the cylinder along C.</span> </p><p><span m='1366000'>If you walk clockwise,
  you will see that the surface</span> <span m='1372000'>is to your left or use the
  right-hand rule.</span> </p><p><span m='1377000'>Now, if a problem gives you neither
  the orientation of a</span> <span m='1380000'>curve nor that of the surface then
  it's up to you to make them</span> <span m='1384000'>up. But you have to make them
  up in</span> <span m='1385000'>a consistent way. You cannot choose them both at</span>
  <span m='1389000'>random. All right.</span> </p><p><span m='1393000'>Now we're all
  set to try to use Stokes' theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='1410000'>Well, let me
  do an example first.</span> </p><p><span m='1415000'>The first example that I will
  do is actually a comparison.</span> </p><p><span m='1423000'>Stokes' versus Green.
  I want to show you how Green's</span> <span m='1432000'>theorem for work that we
  saw in the plane,</span> <span m='1435000'>but also involved work and curl and so
  on,</span> <span m='1438000'>is actually a special case of this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1444000'>Let's say that we will look at the special case where our curve</span>
  <span m='1451000'>C is actually a curve in the x, y plane.</span> </p><p><span m='1456000'>And
  let's make it go counterclockwise in the x,</span> <span m='1459000'>y plane because
  that's what we did for Green's theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='1463000'>Now let's
  choose a surface bounded by this curve.</span> </p><p><span m='1465000'>Well, as
  I said, I could make up any surface</span> <span m='1468000'>that comes to my mind.
  But, if I want to relate to</span> <span m='1472000'>this stuff, I should probably
  stay in the x,</span> <span m='1475000'>y plane. So I am just going to take my</span>
  <span m='1478000'>surface to be the piece of the x, y plane that is inside my</span>
  <span m='1483000'>curve. So let's say S is going to be a</span> <span m='1492000'>portion
  of x, y plane bounded by a curve C,</span> <span m='1502000'>and the curve C goes
  counterclockwise.</span> </p><p><span m='1511000'>Well, then I should look at [the
  table?].</span> </p><p><span m='1517000'>For work along C of my favorite vector
  field F dot dr.</span> </p><p><span m='1524000'>So that will be the line integral
  of Pdx plus Qdy.</span> </p><p><span m='1531000'>Like I said, if I call the components
  of my</span> <span m='1534000'>field P, Q and R, it will be Pdx plus Qdy plus</span>
  <span m='1538000'>Rdz, but I don't have any Z here.</span> </p><p><span m='1542000'>Dz
  is zero on C. If I evaluate for line</span> <span m='1549000'>integral, I don't
  have any term involving dz.</span> </p><p><span m='1553000'>Z is zero. Now, let's
  see what Strokes</span> <span m='1559000'>says. Stokes says instead I can</span>
  <span m='1565000'>compute for flux through S of curve F.</span> </p><p><span m='1573000'>But
  now what's the normal vector to my surface?</span> </p><p><span m='1577000'>Well,
  it's going to be either k or negative k.</span> </p><p><span m='1579000'>I just
  have to figure out which one it is.</span> </p><p><span m='1582000'>Well, if you
  followed what we've done there,</span> <span m='1585000'>you know that the normal
  vector compatible with this choice for</span> <span m='1590000'>the curve C is the
  one that points up.</span> </p><p><span m='1592000'>My normal vector is just going
  to be k hat, so I am going to</span> <span m='1603000'>replace my normal vector
  by k hat.</span> </p><p><span m='1609000'>That means, actually, I will be integrating
  curl dot</span> <span m='1613000'>k. That means I am integrating the</span> <span
  m='1616000'>z component of curl. Let's look at curl F dot k.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1624000'>That's the z component of curl F.</span> </p><p><span m='1634000'>And
  what's the z component of curl?</span> </p><p><span m='1638000'>Well, I conveniently
  still have the values up there.</span> </p><p><span m='1641000'>It's Q sub x minus
  P sub y. My double integral becomes</span> <span m='1656000'>double integral of
  Q sub x minus P sub y.</span> </p><p><span m='1662000'>What about dS? Well, I am
  in a piece of the x,</span> <span m='1666000'>y plane, so dS is just dxdy or your
  favorite combination that</span> <span m='1672000'>does the same thing. Now, see,
  if you look at this</span> <span m='1676000'>equality, integral of Pdx plus Qdy
  along a closed curve equals</span> <span m='1682000'>double integral of Qx minus
  Py dxdy.</span> </p><p><span m='1685000'>That is exactly the statement of Green's
  theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='1691000'>I mean except at that time we called things
  m and n,</span> <span m='1697000'>but really that shouldn't matter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1700000'>This tells you that, in fact, Green's theorem is</span> <span m='1715000'>just
  a special case of Stokes' in the x, y plane.</span> </p><p><span m='1731000'>Now,
  another small remark I want to make right away before I</span> <span m='1735000'>forget,
  you might think that these</span> <span m='1737000'>rules that we've made up about
  compatibility of orientations</span> <span m='1741000'>are completely arbitrary.
  Well, they are literally in the</span> <span m='1745000'>same way as our convention
  for which we guy curl is arbitrary.</span> </p><p><span m='1750000'>We chose to
  make the curl be this thing and not the opposite</span> <span m='1754000'>which
  would have been pretty much just as sensible.</span> </p><p><span m='1757000'>And,
  ultimately, that comes from our choice of</span> <span m='1761000'>making the cross-product
  be what it is but of the opposite.</span> </p><p><span m='1765000'>Ultimately, it
  all comes from our preference for right-handed</span> <span m='1770000'>coordinate
  systems. If we had been on the planet</span> <span m='1773000'>with left-handed
  coordinate systems then actually our</span> <span m='1776000'>conventions would
  be all the other way around,</span> <span m='1780000'>but they are this way. Any
  other questions?</span> </p><p><span m='1805000'>A surface that you use in Stokes'
  theorem is usually not</span> <span m='1808000'>going to be closed because its boundary
  needs to be the curve</span> <span m='1812000'>C. So if you had a closed surface</span>
  <span m='1814000'>you wouldn't know where to put your curve.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1817000'>I mean of course you could make a tiny hole in it and get a tiny</span>
  <span m='1820000'>curve. Actually, what that would say,</span> <span m='1822000'>and
  we are going to see more about that so not very important</span> <span m='1826000'>right
  now, but what we would see is that</span> <span m='1828000'>for a close surface
  we would end up getting zero for the flux.</span> </p><p><span m='1831000'>And that
  is actually because divergence of curl is zero,</span> <span m='1834000'>but I am
  getting ahead of myself.</span> </p><p><span m='1836000'>We are going to see that
  probably tomorrow in more</span> <span m='1845000'>detail. Stokes' theorem only
  works if</span> <span m='1849000'>you can make sense of this. That means you need
  your vector</span> <span m='1853000'>field to be continuous and differentiable everywhere
  on the</span> <span m='1858000'>surface S. Now, why is that relevant?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1863000'>Well, say that your vector field was not defined at the</span> <span
  m='1865000'>origin and say that you wanted to do,</span> <span m='1867000'>you know,
  the example that I had first with the unit circling</span> <span m='1871000'>the
  x, y plane. Normally, the most sensible</span> <span m='1874000'>choice of surface
  to apply Stokes' theorem to would be just</span> <span m='1877000'>the flat disk
  in the x, y plane.</span> </p><p><span m='1879000'>But that assumes that your vector
  field is well-defined</span> <span m='1883000'>there. If your vector field is not</span>
  <span m='1884000'>defined at the origin but defined everywhere else you</span> <span
  m='1887000'>cannot use this guy, but maybe you can still use,</span> <span m='1889000'>say,
  the half-sphere, for example.</span> </p><p><span m='1891000'>Or, you could use
  a piece of cylinder plus a flat top or</span> <span m='1895000'>whatever you want
  but not pressing for the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='1898000'>So you could still
  use Stokes but you'd have to be careful</span> <span m='1901000'>about which surface
  you choose. Now, if instead your vector</span> <span m='1904000'>field is not defined
  anywhere on the z-axis then you're out of</span> <span m='1909000'>luck because
  there is no way to find a surface bounded by this</span> <span m='1914000'>unit
  circle without crossing the z-axis somewhere.</span> </p><p><span m='1919000'>Then
  you wouldn't be able to Stokes' theorem at all or at</span> <span m='1927000'>least
  not directly. Maybe I should write it F</span> <span m='1936000'>defines a differentiable
  everywhere on this.</span> </p><p><span m='1945000'>But we don't care about what
  happens outside of this.</span> </p><p><span m='1947000'>It's really only on the
  surface that we need it to be OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1955000'>I mean, again,
  99% of the vector fields that</span> <span m='1959000'>we see in this class are
  defined everywhere so that's not an</span> <span m='1964000'>urgent concern, but
  still.</span> </p><p><span m='1967000'>OK. Should we move on?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1969000'>Yes. I have a yes. Let me explain to you quickly</span> <span m='1981000'>why
  Stokes is true. How do we prove a theorem like</span> <span m='1988000'>that? Well,</span>
  <span m='1990000'>the strategy, I mean there are other ways,</span> <span m='1992000'>but
  the least painful strategy at this point is to observe what</span> <span m='1996000'>we
  already know is a special case of Stokes's theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='1999000'>Namely
  we know the case where the curve is actually in the x,</span> <span m='2002000'>y
  plane and the surface is a flat piece of the x,</span> <span m='2004000'>y plane
  because that's Green's theorem which we proved a while</span> <span m='2014000'>ago.
  We know it for C and S in the</span> <span m='2022000'>x, y plane. Now, what if
  C and S were,</span> <span m='2027000'>say, in the y, z plane instead of the x,</span>
  <span m='2029000'>y plane? Well, then it will not quite</span> <span m='2031000'>give
  the same picture because the normal vector would be i hat</span> <span m='2035000'>instead
  of k hat and they would be having different notations</span> <span m='2038000'>and
  it would be integrating with y and z.</span> </p><p><span m='2041000'>But you see
  that it would become, again,</span> <span m='2042000'>exactly the same formula.
  We'd know it for any of the</span> <span m='2045000'>coordinate planes. In fact,
  I claim we know it for</span> <span m='2048000'>absolutely any plane. And the reason
  for that is,</span> <span m='2053000'>sure, when we write it in coordinates,</span>
  <span m='2055000'>when we write that this line integral is integral of Pdx plus</span>
  <span m='2059000'>Qdy plus Rdz or when we write that the curl is given by this</span>
  <span m='2064000'>formula we use the x, y, z coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2068000'>But there is something I haven't quite told you about.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2070000'>Which is if I switch to any other right-handed coordinate</span> <span
  m='2073000'>system, so I do some sort of rotation</span> <span m='2075000'>of my
  space coordinates, then somehow the line integral,</span> <span m='2080000'>the
  flux integral, the notion of curl makes sense</span> <span m='2084000'>in coordinates.
  And the reason is that they all</span> <span m='2087000'>have geometric interpretations.
  For example,</span> <span m='2090000'>when I think of this as the work done by a
  force,</span> <span m='2092000'>well, the force doesn't care whether it's being
  put in x,</span> <span m='2095000'>y coordinates this way or that way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2096000'>It still does the same work because it's the same force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2100000'>And when I say that the curl measures the rotation in a</span> <span
  m='2103000'>motion, well, that depends on which</span> <span m='2106000'>coordinates
  you use. And the same for interpretation</span> <span m='2109000'>of flux. In fact,
  if I rotated my</span> <span m='2112000'>coordinates to fit with any other plane,
  I could still do</span> <span m='2117000'>the same things. What I'm trying to say
  is,</span> <span m='2123000'>in fact, if C and S are in any plane then we can still
  claim</span> <span m='2131000'>that it reduces to Green's theorem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2137000'>It will be Green's theorem not in x, y, z coordinates but in</span>
  <span m='2145000'>some funny rotated coordinate systems.</span> </p><p><span m='2150000'>What
  I'm saying is that work, flux and curl makes sense</span> <span m='2156000'>independently
  of coordinates.</span> </p><p><span m='2180000'>Now, this has to stop somewhere.
  I can start claiming that I can</span> <span m='2183000'>somehow bend my coordinates
  to a plane, any surface is flat.</span> </p><p><span m='2186000'>That doesn't really
  work. But what I can say is if I have</span> <span m='2189000'>any surface I can
  cut it into tiny pieces.</span> </p><p><span m='2191000'>And these tiny pieces are
  basically flat.</span> </p><p><span m='2195000'>So that's basically the idea of
  a proof.</span> </p><p><span m='2199000'>I am going to decompose my surface into
  very small flat</span> <span m='2207000'>pieces. Given any S we are just going</span>
  <span m='2216000'>to decompose it into tiny almost flat pieces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2228000'>For example, if I have my surface like this,</span> <span m='2235000'>what
  I will do is I will just cut it into tiles.</span> </p><p><span m='2243000'>I mean
  a good example of that is if you look at</span> <span m='2248000'>[UNINTELLIGIBLE],
  for example,</span> <span m='2251000'>it's made of all these hexagons and pentagons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2256000'>Well, actually, they're not quite flat in the</span> <span
  m='2258000'>usual rule, but you could make them flat and it would still</span> <span
  m='2261000'>look pretty much like a sphere. Anyway, you're going to cut</span> <span
  m='2265000'>your surface into lots of tiny pieces.</span> </p><p><span m='2269000'>And
  then you can use Stokes' theorem on each small piece.</span> </p><p><span m='2273000'>What
  it says on each small flat piece -- It says that the line</span> <span m='2280000'>integral
  along say, for example,</span> <span m='2284000'>this curve is equal to the flux
  of a curl through this tiny</span> <span m='2288000'>piece of surface. And now I
  will add all of these</span> <span m='2292000'>terms together. If I add all of the
  small</span> <span m='2294000'>contributions to flux I get the total flux.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2297000'>What if I add all of the small line integrals?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2299000'>Well, I get lots of extra junk because I never asked to compute</span>
  <span m='2303000'>the line integral along this. But this guy will come in twice</span>
  <span m='2306000'>when I do this little plate and when I do that little plate with</span>
  <span m='2310000'>opposite orientations. When I sum all of the little</span> <span
  m='2314000'>line integrals together, all of the inner things cancel</span> <span
  m='2318000'>out, and the only ones that I go</span> <span m='2320000'>through only
  once are those that are at the outer most edges.</span> </p><p><span m='2324000'>So,
  when I sum all of my works together, I will get the work</span> <span m='2330000'>done
  just along the outer boundary C.</span> </p><p><span m='2334000'>Sum of work around
  each little piece is just actually the work</span> <span m='2352000'>along C, the
  outer curve. And the sum of the flux for</span> <span m='2367000'>each piece is
  going to be the flux through S.</span> </p><p><span m='2379000'>From Stokes' theorem
  for flat surfaces, I can get it for any</span> <span m='2385000'>surface. I am cheating
  a little bit</span> <span m='2387000'>because you would actually have to check carefully
  that this</span> <span m='2390000'>approximately where you flatten the little pieces
  that are</span> <span m='2393000'>almost flat is [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. But, trust me,</span>
  </p><p><span m='2396000'>it actually works.</span> </p><p><span m='2413000'>Let's
  do an actual example. I mean I said example,</span> <span m='2415000'>but that was
  more like getting us ready for the proof so</span> <span m='2419000'>probably that
  doesn't count as an actual example.</span> </p><p><span m='2422000'>I should probably
  keep these statements for now so I am not</span> <span m='2425000'>going to erase
  this side.</span> </p><p><span m='2468000'>Let's do an example. Let's try to find
  the work of</span> <span m='2481000'>vector field zi plus xj plus yk around the
  unit circle in the x,</span> <span m='2500000'>y plane counterclockwise. The picture
  is conveniently</span> <span m='2518000'>already there. Just as a quick review,</span>
  <span m='2525000'>let's see how we do that directly.</span> </p><p><span m='2528000'>If
  we do that directly, I have to find the integral</span> <span m='2534000'>along
  C. So F dot dr becomes zdx plus</span> <span m='2541000'>xdy plus ydz. But now we
  actually know that</span> <span m='2548000'>on this circle, well, z is zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2553000'>And we can parameterize x and y, the unit circle in the
  x,</span> <span m='2559000'>y plane, so we can take x equals cosine t,</span> <span
  m='2564000'>y equals sine t. That will just become the</span> <span m='2569000'>integral
  over C. Well, z times dx,</span> <span m='2574000'>z is zero so we have nothing,
  plus x is cosine t times dy is</span> <span m='2585000'>-- Well, if y is sine t
  then dy is cosine tdt plus ydz but z is</span> <span m='2597000'>zero. Now, the
  range of values for t,</span> <span m='2602000'>well, we are going counterclockwise
  around the</span> <span m='2606000'>entire circle so that should go from zero to
  2pi.</span> </p><p><span m='2611000'>We will get integral from zero to 2pi of cosine
  square tdt</span> <span m='2619000'>which, if you do the calculation, turns out
  to be</span> <span m='2625000'>just pi. Now, let's instead try to use</span> <span
  m='2630000'>Stokes' theorem to do the calculation.</span> </p><p><span m='2635000'>Now,
  of course the smart choice would be to just take the flat</span> <span m='2640000'>unit
  disk. I am not going to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2642000'>That would be too
  boring. Plus we have already kind of</span> <span m='2646000'>checked it because
  we already trust Green's theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='2649000'>Instead, just
  to convince you that,</span> <span m='2651000'>yes, I can choose really any surface
  I want,</span> <span m='2654000'>let's say that I'm going to choose a piece of paraboloid
  z</span> <span m='2663000'>equals one minus x squared minus y squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2670000'>Well, to get our conventions straight, we should take the</span> <span
  m='2676000'>normal vector pointing up for compatibility with our choice.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2683000'>Well, we will have to compute the flux through S.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2688000'>We don't really have to because we could have chosen the
  disk,</span> <span m='2690000'>it would be easier, but if we want to do it this</span>
  <span m='2694000'>way we will compute the flux of curl F through our paraboloid.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2700000'>How do we do that? Well, we need to find the curl</span>
  <span m='2703000'>and we need to find ndS. Let's start with the curl.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2710000'>Curl F let's take the cross-product between dell and F</span> <span
  m='2723000'>which is zxy. If we compute this,</span> <span m='2728000'>the i component
  will be one minus zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2731000'>It looks like it is one
  i. Minus the j component is zero</span> <span m='2737000'>minus one. Plus the k
  component is one</span> <span m='2741000'>minus zero. In fact, the curl of the field</span>
  <span m='2752000'>is one, one, one. Now, what about ndS?</span> </p><p><span m='2759000'>Well,
  this is a surface for which we know z is a function of</span> <span m='2763000'>x
  and y. ndS we can write as,</span> <span m='2768000'>let's call this F of xy, then
  we can use the formula</span> <span m='2774000'>that says ndS equals negative F
  sub x, negative F sub y,</span> <span m='2779000'>one dxdy, which here gives us
  2x,</span> <span m='2786000'>2y, one dxdy. Now, when we want to compute</span> <span
  m='2794000'>the flux, we will have to do double integral over S of one,</span> <span
  m='2801000'>one, one dot product with 2x, 2y, one dxdy.</span> </p><p><span m='2807000'>It
  will become the double integral of 2x plus 2y plus one</span> <span m='2815000'>dxdy.
  And, of course,</span> <span m='2818000'>the region which we are integrating, the
  range of values</span> <span m='2821000'>of x and y will be the shadow of our surface.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2824000'>That is just going to be, if you look at this paraboloid</span>
  <span m='2827000'>from above, all you will see is the unit</span> <span m='2831000'>disk
  so it will be a double integral of the unit disk.</span> </p><p><span m='2837000'>And
  the way we will do that, one way is to switch to polar</span> <span m='2843000'>coordinates
  and do the calculation and then you will</span> <span m='2848000'>end up with pi.
  The other way is to try to do</span> <span m='2851000'>it by symmetry. Observe,
  when you integrate x</span> <span m='2854000'>above this, x is as negative on the
  left as it is positive on</span> <span m='2857000'>the right. So the integral of
  x will be</span> <span m='2860000'>zero. The integral of y will be zero</span> <span
  m='2862000'>also by symmetry. Then the integral of one dxdy</span> <span m='2866000'>will
  just be the area of this unit disk which is pi.</span> </p><p><span m='2872000'>That
  was our first example. And, of course,</span> <span m='2874000'>if you're actually
  free to choose your favorite surface,</span> <span m='2877000'>there is absolutely
  no reason why you would actually choose</span> <span m='2881000'>this paraboloid
  in this example. I mean it would be much easier</span> <span m='2884000'>to choose
  a flat disk. OK.</span> </p><p><span m='2885000'>Tomorrow I will tell you a few
  more things about curl fits in</span> <span m='2889000'>with conservativeness and
  with the divergence theorem,</span> <span m='2893000'>Stokes all together, and we
  will look at Practice</span> <span m='2897000'>Exam 4B so please bring the exam
  with you.</span> </p><p><span m='2900000'>with you.</span> </p>
